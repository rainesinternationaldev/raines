In a July 2015 survey of 52 recruiters by the Association of Executive Search and Leaderships Consultants for The Wall Street Journal, the association found that &#8220;nearly 80% of U.S. recruiters are more willing than they were a decade ago to consider executive prospects who stay less than three years&#8221; in one job.</p>\n<p>With such conflicting claims, it begs the question: Are attitudes toward job hopping really changing? Will job hopping hurt your career? And, if job-hopping isn’t an automatic disqualifier, should you stay or should you go?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Should you stay?</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Many see job-hopping as a quick way to boost their income, as a new company will typically add significantly to your base salary </span><a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/03/news/economy/jobs-wages-salary-quitting/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">compared with staying in-house</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> and receiving periodical raises and promotions. Despite the draws of instant gratification, it’s important to remember that successful high-level career trajectories featuring frequent, short stints are the exception, not the rule. The obvious red flag? It’s rare to achieve significant results repeatedly in a short period. Innovation takes time. Developing and executing initiatives that do add value can’t be done overnight; it takes a while to turn a ship around, so how much can you actually accomplish in a short stint?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">If a new executive comes in and there is growth the next quarter, are those the results of the new employee, or residual effects from the last person in that position?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">In lower and mid-level positions, you may achieve quick gains, but candidates with a history of job-hopping will be looked upon with reservations once reaching the upper echelons of a company. Put yourself in the position of the employer: If you’re looking for continuity and long-term commitment to your company’s goals, why pick a serial job-hopper over a similar candidate with a history of devoting years to a company? History shows that there is more potential for increased growth and success based on performance if you stay in a position or with a company. “Job-hopping might be the sprint to $100,000,”  Raines International Managing Director Josh Zigman explains, “but driving results through continuity is the journey to $1-5 million.”</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Should you go?</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Despite the clear benefits of remaining at your current company for longer, rather than shorter periods of time, we at Raines Perspectives know that sometimes an opportunity really is too good to pass up, even if the timing isn’t right. When asked how to market your decision to go, Zigman explains, “Job hopping isn’t necessarily a black mark on a resume, but it should be done with purpose and a goal in mind&#8230;You must be able to detail why you made the move, what it added to your development, and if you will continue to job hop or stay at your next company.”  If you decide to leave your company for a better opportunity, be thoughtful about it. Every time you leave a company, you are exercising your judgment, so be prepared to rationalize and defend that judgment in the event that you are questioned about your move in the future.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Our takeaway:</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p>When it comes to your career, the stakes are high, and every move matters. Yet, beyond each jump from company to company, industry to industry, how you perform, the deep experience you develop, and the skills you strengthen can speak louder than the dates on a resume. “Whether you stay in one place for 30 years or 30 months, the most important thing is to deliver value, develop skills, and build a diverse powerful network,” Zigman recommends. So, beyond the caveats to job hopping, we must admit that there isn’t one perfect one-size-fits-all answer for job hopping and, as with many questions, the answer lies in the middle.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "title": "5 Tips for Better Networking",
      "URL": "https://rainesinternational.wordpress.com/2016/12/08/5-tips-for-better-networking/",
      "short_URL": "http://wp.me/p7C5yw-2wr",
      "content": "<hr />\n<p>When finding your next big opportunity, your network is key.  Most of us have increased confidence when we are interviewing or hiring someone who worked with a friend or colleague and received glowing recommendations. A lot of hiring managers (even at the CEO level) will take a crack at recruiting someone to their team before they engage internal Talent Acquisition / Human Resources or an external search firm. As an executive search firm ourselves, we very much value the thoughts of our contacts on referrals.</p>\n<p>Articles come out on a weekly basis discussing “How to network better” or “How not to make networking mistakes.”  Networking is a funny thing. Most of the people who would call themselves “natural networkers” are some of the worst networkers and time wasters out there. And some people who have really dry personalities and who don’t like talking to a lot of people at parties are some of the most effective networkers out there. The key is to keep in touch with people on some level, not just when you are in the market looking for something. Effective networking takes time, and it takes helpfulness – both helping others and helping others to help you.</p>\n<p>1. Help others: Attempt to respond to emails from people who seek to network with you, and in return, they will then be more likely to respond to your outreach when you need them.  If someone with an impressive resume emails you asking about opportunities at your company, pass it along or to someone you know who could provide a connection.  He or she may land in a new spot within 3 to 6 months, and can be your advocate down the line.</p>\n<p>2. Help others help you. When leaning on your network in search of a new opportunity,  make it as easy as possible for them. Know what you want, and be specific – both with what it is you want and where you make sense. Mention specific companies when possible. For example, “I have deep experience in strategy consulting and prior experience in the retail industry. I am targeting a Director or VP of Strategy (or Merchandising Strategy) role with a retailer.  Target companies include X, Y, and Z.”</p>\n<p>3. Don’t appear desperate – people don’t want to be affiliated with desperate people.</p>\n<p>4. Don’t fall off the map. People tend to update their LinkedIn profile while they are looking for a new role (like when a private company gears up on press releases before going public), but then they don’t update it when they land in their new spot. As you take on new roles or succeed in key projects, or as you are quoted in trade rags and things like that, share the information with your network (in a down-to-earth fashion) so that they associate you with success and action.</p>\n<p>5. Create a personal Board of Directors: And now for the individuals who will likely be the most important in your network. As early as possible, start assembling an informal “board” of career advisers who will help guide and mentor you throughout your career beyond an individual move.  Your board will push you to make more of yourself and will scold you when you start to slip. As with general networking, by keeping your board up to date on where you are with your career, they will be able to share valuable perspective with you.  One of them may even end up hiring you down the line.</p>\n<p>In assembling your board, make sure you choose wisely, as these will be the people who keep you on track throughout your career.  Your board should be more than one person, and not just a group of “yes men.”  As an Engagement Manager at a consulting firm, whose opinion would you rather have when deciding on a job offer?  Another Engagement Manager who spent two years at an investment bank before business school, or someone who left your firm, went corporate in a strategy role, and is currently a President of a business unit somewhere? Pick people who have been highly successful and who are willing to devote time to you, and focus on getting the hot shots into your network now, before they take off and become CEOs and are harder to approach.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Most importantly, stay engaged, reciprocate, and create a genuine, even if infrequent, connection with members of your network.</p>\n<p>Any other tips you think we should include? E-mail perspectives@rainesinternational.com. Happy networking!</p>\n",

      "content": "<p><strong>By Pauly Rodney</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p>For the last several months, Americans from coast to coast discussed issues of race and ethnicity.  Not everyone wanted to weigh in on the topic &#8212; but it’s difficult to ignore family, friends, and co-workers discussing player protests at athletic events, news coverage of unrest in minority communities, or even the presidential election.  As much coverage as each of those events have received, another discussion of race and gender has been taking place among advertising agency executives, and that discussion is being led by the brands they represent.</p>\n<p>The pattern has become all too familiar.  Ad agencies claim a commitment to diversity; a newspaper article will highlight allegedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/03/saatchi-saatchi-boss-kevin-roberts-resigns-amid-sexism-row\">sexist</a> or <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/03/17/ad-agency-splits-with-ceo-accused-of-rape-jokes-racist-remarks/\">racist</a> behavior that seems more “Mad Men” than multicultural; a lawsuit will follow; ad executives will say the bad behavior was a one-off, that they addressed it, and will vow to <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/agencyspy/jwt-will-move-beyond-the-gustavo-martinez-scandal-with-a-diversity-and-inclusion-council/109294\">double down</a> on their commitment to diversity … only to have another ugly incident come to light.  Wash, rinse, repeat.</p>\n<p>Is Madison Avenue really full of bad behavior?  Is anyone taking effective steps to address the culture?  Is there a secret recipe to promoting diversity? Ad agencies have gotten tired of answering those questions, and so have the brands they represent.  Several brands with a collective ad-spend in the billions of dollars are experimenting with ways to ensure accountability on diversity. General Mills, HP, &amp; Verizon are leading a wave of forcing ad agencies to embrace diversity.  How well each company does may just change the agency culture more than the agencies themselves have been able to.</p>\n<p>In August, General Mills <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/agencyspy/general-mills-insists-that-its-future-agencies-meet-specific-diversity-quotas/116194\">announced</a> that any agency seeking to represent its iconic food brands (including Cheerios, Pillsbury, and Yoplait) needs to have a diverse creative staff.  Specifically, GM called for at least 50% women and 20% people of color on the creative teams doing the work.  With over $700 million in annual ad spend, General Mills earned considerable praise, and a fair bit of backlash over what their critics are calling quotas.  Shortly after, Antonio Lucio, Chief Marketing Officer for HP, <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/hp-demands-ad-agencies-diversify-their-workforces-1472820226\">demanded</a> that HP’s agencies diversify their workforce.  Instead of hitting specific targets, Lucio gave all agencies working with HP 30 days to submit their plans for achieving a diverse workforce in order to be a part of HP’s $1 billion ad spend.  Shortly thereafter, Verizon cited HP’s example in making the same request of their agencies.  In 2015, Verizon <a href=\"http://adage.com/article/advertising/top-200-u-s-advertisers-spend-smarter/304625/\">spent</a> $2.7 billion on advertising, among the highest ad spends in the country.</p>\n<p>This is the not the first time that General Mills, HP, and Verizon dealt with diversity in a highly visible manner.  General Mills’ “Cheerios” brand received attention when one of their ads featured an interracial couple with a mixed-race daughter.  Many viewers <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/31/cheerios-commercial-racist-backlash_n_3363507.html\">welcomed</a> a commercial that looked like their own family and friends, and others were aghast.  General Mills <a href=\"http://gawker.com/cheerios-ad-starring-interracial-family-predictably-sum-510591871\">stood</a> above the fray, saying the company wanted to &#8220;celebrate&#8221; all types of families.  HP already has <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/tech-diversity-hewlett-packard-adds-numerous-women-african-americans-boards-its-new-2050664\">one of the most diverse boards in tech</a>, with five women (including CEO and Board Chair Meg Whitman) and people of color comprising nearly half of its board.   Verizon has long <a href=\"http://www.verizon.com/about/our-company/awards-recognition?field_award_category_tid=113\">received</a> awards for its commitment to diversity, including making the Best Companies for Multicultural Women list every year since 2005, and the Top Company for Executive Women list.</p>\n<p>Nor are these three brands the first to attempt to diversify staffing within their industries.  Facebook very publicly announced a “point system” for recruiters who find females and diverse candidates as over 90% of its staff is either white or Asian.  The system <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/facebooks-point-system-fails-to-close-diversity-gap-1471387288\">made little difference</a> in the makeup of its workforce, with Facebook <a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/07/facebook-diversity-update-positive-hiring-trends-show-progress/\">blaming</a> the pipeline … essentially saying not enough talented women nor people of color exist.  As a recent LeanIn/McKinsey study makes clear, <a href=\"http://perspectives.rainesinternational.com/article/9171\">that is not the case</a>.</p>\n<p>Industries have focused on diversity for decades.  Even prior to entering the workforce, many nonprofits and industry-backed programs help women and students of color get into college for specific majors where they are not well-represented.  In the last decade or so, nonprofits and industry-backed programs have also helped students earn jobs in those industries where historically, there has been under-representation.  For years the industries and companies themselves have identified women and people of color to hire and promote.  If a company is unable to retain diverse talent, or unable to find the diverse talent that is already in the system, it no longer seems negligent on their part, it appears intentional.</p>\n<p>Companies constantly launch diversity programs to check a box.  Unfortunately, many are not tied to business metrics such as measuring the impact on retention, or leveraging the workforce for new business opportunities.  In absence of business objectives, Diversity and Inclusion runs the risk of only being lip service.  The decisions by General Mills, HP, and Verizon represent brands admitting that, to move the needle on diversity, they need the support and collaboration of their partner agencies.  &#8220;We owe this to ourselves, to each other and to future generations,&#8221; Lucio said in a letter to agencies. &#8220;By making the important and necessary changes today, together we can bend the arc of history in favor of inclusion and opportunity. Now comes the proof of our commitment.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Thinking through Diversity &amp; Inclusion is difficult, and tying it back to business goals is more difficult still.  If approached properly, the companies that invest the time and resources into having a diverse workforce and an inclusive workplace can reap benefits for many years to come in terms of retention and even generating additional revenue.  General Mills, HP, and Verizon are the first to force advertisers to try a new approach to diversity. They will not be the last.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.lawrencebundy.com/2016/04/05/john-lewis-jr-joins-lawrence-bundy/\">John Lewis, Jr.,</a> former Chief Diversity Officer of Coca-Cola, recently told some Raines International staffers that “there is a wave coming. You either ride that wave, or get crushed by it. But everyone can see the wave coming.”</p>\n<p>What will you do?</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.rainesinternational.com/paul-a.-p.-rodney.html\">Pauly Rodney</a> is Vice President and Co-Head for Diversity and Inclusion at Raines International.</em></p>\n",

This month, Raines Perspectives looked at a sampling of 350+ 2009 MBAs who went directly into one of the &#8220;Big Three&#8221; firms &#8212; Bain &amp; Company, Boston Consulting Group, and McKinsey &amp; Company. We wanted to find out where these consultants are and what their path looked like.

Related, Bloomberg Businessweek published this week its annual ranking of the best business schools. Harvard and Stanford topped the list. See who else made the cut.

Michelle Weise at Harvard Business Review suggested that employers find a way to easily assess candidates&#8217; soft and hard skills.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We might see skills such as strong writing and editing, public speaking, planning and organizing, time management, technology skills, problem-solving, critical thinking, reasoning, negotiating, and decision-making, adaptability, professionalism and customer focus.&#8221; Weise wrote. &#8220;Technical skills could be viewed and validated alongside the &#8216;softer&#8217; skills that so many companies are looking for.&#8221; Read <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/09/we-need-a-better-way-to-visualize-peoples-skills?utm_campaign=harvardbiz&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social\">&#8220;We Need a Better Way to Visualize People&#8217;s Skills.&#8221;</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4.

Of those consultants who transitioned into an industry role, the 2009 MBA class also shows consistency in flight for Big Three consultants, with the majority leaving their firms at the pre-Principal/Manager/Associate Principal level.</p>\n<p>For the industry landscape, changes are certainly underway, with an increasing portion of consulting talent flocking towards the tech &amp; media industries. With a wealth of opportunities arising in tech startups, virtual reality, self-driving cars, and more, the tech &amp; media space has emerged has a compelling landing spot for many consultants looking to leave their firms. In addition, our findings suggest that consultants are on the move in more ways than one, as nearly a third of those who transitioned to industry have occupied roles at three or more companies since their initial transition from a big three firm.</p>\n<p>With some patterns prevailing and others shifting, it will be interesting to see how these breakdowns compare for future MBA classes of big three managements consultants.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><em>*Raines International’s information about the moves of 2009 MBAs  was gathered from our internal database and confirmed through online resources (Linkedin, etc.) as of September 2016.</em></em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Send suggestions to perspectives@rainesinternational.com.</em></p>\n<p>1. At Harvard Business Review, Jeff Rodman reflected on his 25 years with Polycom and how important it is to focus on the small things when innovating.  <b>&#8220;</b>Zeroing in on small innovations leads to big breakthroughs,&#8221; Rodman wrote. &#8220;After all, the hinge for innovation, as cliché as it might sound, is doing more with less.&#8221; As an example, he pointed to Polycom&#8217;s approach in simplifying and minimizing devices needed to produce loud audio &#8212; like the speakers in our phones.</p>\n<p>Rodman suggested companies look at the details to revolutionize:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Instead of becoming obsessed with<em> big</em>, ask yourself questions like, &#8216;What’s the smallest change we could make in our product, our delivery, our distribution, our organizational structure, or our communication?&#8217; Even better are questions that force you to add by subtraction: &#8216;What could we <em>take away </em>from those same areas to make them better and simplify the process?&#8217;</p>\n<p>Read <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/09/how-i-built-a-2-billion-company-by-thinking-small?utm_campaign=harvardbiz&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social\">&#8220;How I built a $2 billion company by thinking small.&#8221;</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2. Leslie Miley, Director of Engineering at Slack, quit Twitter last year because of its lack of diversity and inclusion. Miley was the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/03/twitter-engineering-manager-leslie-miley-leaves-company-because-of-diversity-issues/\">&#8220;only black engineer in a leadership position at Twitter.</a>&#8221; Forbes&#8217;s Jessica Pliska highlighted seven tips from Miley to improve diversity and inclusion at larger companies, including putting jobs in more diverse areas, standing up for people of color in the workplace, and making sure the company will enforce diversity and inclusion. Read &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jessicapliska/2016/11/01/seven-things-slacks-director-of-engineering-leslie-miley-needs-ceos-to-know-about-diversity/#2ff0513b34d9\">Seven Things Slack&#8217;s Director of Engineering Leslie Miley Needs CEOs to Know about Diversity.&#8221;</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3. Pricewaterhouse Coopers&#8217; US Chairman and Senior Partner Tim Ryan discussed the recent TED Women conference he attended in San Francisco and what he learned about diversity and inclusion. Ryan listed four things for business leaders to consider when promoting diversity and inclusion:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>&#8220;Do you cast a wide net?&#8221; &#8212; Are you making sure diverse perspectives are being considered?</li>\n<li>&#8220;Have you thrown off your potential blinders?&#8221; &#8212; Be aware of unconscious bias.</li>\n<li>&#8220;Is everyone part of the effort?&#8221;</li>\n<li>&#8220;Changing the culture means changing our day-to-day microinteractions.&#8221;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Read Ryan&#8217;s post on Medium, <a href=\"https://medium.com/pwc/walk-the-walk-while-talking-the-talk-5e93f5b49ea#.gn25809yj\">&#8220;Walk the Walk While Talking the Talk.&#8221;</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4. Ernst &amp; Young looked at mergers, aquisitions and alliances with its latest reports. According to Ernst &amp; Young&#8217;s study, &#8220;91% of companies are using data and analytics as part of their deal process.&#8221; Ernst &amp; Young also posed five questions for executives:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>&#8220;Are you capitalizing on the breadth of deal structures to realize your strategic objectives?&#8221;</li>\n<li>&#8220;Will geopolitical challenges derail your growth strategies?&#8221;</li>\n<li>&#8220;Are you using analytics and big data to bring greater clarity to complex deals?&#8221;</li>\n<li>&#8220;Is an off-the-sheld approach to integration the best recipe for success?&#8221;</li>\n<li>&#8220;Are you enhancing or destroying the value of acquired innovation?&#8221;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Check out the insights in the full report: <a href=\"http://www.ey.com/gl/en/services/transactions/ey-capital-confidence-barometer\">&#8220;Does seizing competitive advantage mean deals take center stage?&#8221; </a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Send feedback and suggestions to perspectives@rainesinternational.com.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Send suggestions to perspectives@rainesinternational.com.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>1. CIO Journal </em>highlighted a recent study about what factors into a successful &#8220;employment brand.&#8221; The Bersin by Deloitte study of Glassdoor data found that &#8220;a company’s culture and values do more to bolster its &#8217;employment brand&#8217;—its reputation as a prospective employer—than any other factor.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bersin by Deloitte founder and principal Josh Bersin explained that &#8220;this study demonstrates that employees put more emphasis on investment in leadership, culture, and employee development when determining whether to recommend their own companies as excellent places to work.&#8221; Read <a href=\"http://deloitte.wsj.com/cio/2016/09/01/culture-careers-drive-employment-brand/?platform=hootsuite\">&#8220;Culture, Careers Drive Employment Brand</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2. Tech company Intel is putting even more money behind diversity efforts, promising to invest $125 million in by 2021 in its Diversity Fund. The fund, which Intel started last year with an original $125 million donation, &#8220;provides access to the company&#8217;s business development programs and extensive technology expertise in addition to the capital itself,&#8221; according to Engadget.</p>\n<p>Intel&#8217;s<a href=\"https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-capital-expands-diversity-fund/\"> Oct. 26 press release</a> noted that the fund &#8220;will expand beyond its initial focus on startups led by women and underrepresented minorities to also include U.S.-based entrepreneurs from the LGBTQ community, entrepreneurs living with disabilities and military veterans.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Read <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016/10/28/intel-capital-diversity-fund-125-million-investment/\">&#8220;Intel diversity fund expands to veteran, LGBTQ and disabled founders.&#8221;</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3 Beyond the obvious problems at Wells Fargo given its current scandal of fake bank accounts, Harvard Business Review&#8217;s Susan M. Ochs pointed out the company also has to fix &#8220;critical management issues to prevent the next scandals.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Since now-resigned CEO Josh Stumpf acknowledged that the fraud first was flagged five years ago, Ochs argued  Wells Fargo&#8217;s &#8220;executive team and the board of directors were remarkably slow to see the breadth and gravity of this fraud, and to address it effectively.&#8221; Ochs wrote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;This leadership blind spot is the result of misguided reverence for their culture and its ability to inoculate the bank from systemic problems. It represents a governance breakdown of the highest order for executives and board members. But it appears that some red flags never even reached them: Investigations revealed the bank has ignored, discouraged, and even fired employees who tried to voice concerns about the intimidating culture and unethical practices.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Read &#8220;<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/10/the-leadership-blind-spots-at-wells-fargo&amp;cm_sp=Article-_-Links-_-End%20of%20Page%20Recirculation\">The Leadership Blind Spots at Wells Fargo</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Send tips and feedback to perspectives@rainesinternational.com</em></p>\n",

The Boston Globe highlighted Tim Ryan, the U.S. chairman of PwC, and how he has tried to tackle race issues and concerns in the workplace.  This summer, Ryan held race discussions and he is currently trying to unite other business leaders to strategize a new way &#8220;to address race in the workplace.&#8221; Read <strong><a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2016/10/19/boldtypes/ACcWN6c7I9XXKGG80zbv1I/story.html\">&#8220;PwC chief aims to tackle a tough topic: race in the US.&#8221;</a></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2. At Forbes, Henry DeVries discussed Richard Franzi&#8217;s book <em>Critical Mass: The 10 Explosive Powers of CEO Peer Groups </em>and Franzi&#8217;s advocacy for CEO peer groups. Franzi argues that CEO peer groups allow CEOs to discuss in a &#8220;safe haven&#8221; issues they are facing and get in return &#8220;solid reasoning,&#8221; &#8220;real feedback,&#8221; and guidance among other things.

Procter &amp; Gamble&#8217;s chief brand officer Marc Pritchard detailed how the company relies on creativity to create successful ads for clients. At the recent ANA Masters of Marketing conference, Pritchard explained creativity is the only way to filter through the &#8220;noise&#8221; of so many ads out there.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We decided to step up our game and give consumers the experience they deserve,&#8221; Pritchard said. &#8220;We’ve made a choice to raise the bar on creativity, because the consumers that we serve deserve our very best, and it is the key to unlocking growth.&#8221; Read <strong><a href=\"http://www.thedrum.com/news/2016/10/20/don-t-ever-accept-mediocrity-pg-s-marc-pritchard-tells-marketers-stop-putting-out?utm_content=&amp;utm_campaign=social&amp;utm_source=twitter\">&#8220;&#8216;Don&#8217;t ever accept mediocrity.'&#8221;</a></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Send suggestions and feedback to ssmith@rainesinternational.com.

      "content": "<p>Position: Chief of Staff and Global Head of People</p>\n<p>Current Firm: LivePerson</p>\n<p><em>After three and a half years at a government non-profit organization focusing on improving the city’s economic prospects; and you returned to the corporate world as Chief of Staff at LivePerson. How did you make your way from point A to point B?</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Bloomberg was an atypical government organization to a certain extent because the mayor was known to be running the city like a business, which attracted a lot of excellent business talent to join the government. My role with the industry transformation team was to essentially extend that strategist role to become the industry strategist for a city. It was a wonderful role in terms of giving me the opportunity to operationalize a strategy and I was given sizeable, multi-million dollar budgets that I took and did business development and sales with. I continued to be a strategist and actually operationalized and implemented strategies successfully to deliver results. I had P&amp;L and business development responsibility, so I was able to build partnerships and launch public-private ventures as well. When people look at your resume, those are the skills that will let them know you are a person that makes things happen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">I got the job at LivePerson through networking. I went through a search process at the end of the administration knowing I most likely would not serve the next mayor, taking the time to meet with different people and continuing to narrow my search. With Bloomberg, I basically ran all the industry teams. In each industry, we have a CEO advisor board for the city, so I got to meet so many business executives in the city across industries. In that position, I could leverage that network and start talking to people at different companies and partnering with them on different projects so they knew who I was and my capabilities. I was very lucky I was in the right role working for the right guy and that I had very strong relationships that enabled me to do what I wanted to do. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">By the time I met LivePerson’s CEO, I knew I wanted to work for a midsize company. I knew I wanted to work in an innovative company that’s not afraid of change. My preference was in the technology space given I was a TMT</span> <span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Partner at Oliver Wyman and that the first task I had with the city was to rebuild the technology and media industry. I knew I wanted to work with a leader who I could learn with and learn from, and so I was introduced to Rob Locascio, the LivePerson CEO. There wasn’t a job posted or anything&#8230;I just thought it would be good to meet with him and maybe he could lead me to another contact who was looking to hire someone to join their team. So I met with him a couple times and the conversation was very interesting in terms of what he was trying to do with the business what he was trying to do with the culture of the company. Eventually, he asked me to join the team and created the Chief of Staff role for me to work as his right hand.</span></p>\n<p><em>What were the most notable differences you experienced transitioning from the public sector to a publicly-traded tech company? Where there any unforeseen surprises or challenges?</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">To be honest, it wasn’t that difficult. I think the New York City Economic Development Corporation was a great training ground because the people in government are so different from the people in consulting. Consulting is full of super ‘Type A’ individuals, who are driven and committed and whom you can really rely on to deliver results. As a manager, you know exactly what carrots you need to dangle in front of them to get that horse moving. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">When you move into the government, people are motivated by completely different carrots. They are a group of people who have more of a business background or for-profit mindset that “we need to deliver results.” It’s all about the results. It’s about jobs, it’s about companies and everyone is driven in a way where you know you can rely on them. Even though the government is considered to be a 9 to 5 job, no one works 9 to 5. These are people who work late because they are passionate about what they do and deliver. The carrots for those people are different. They are motivated by the challenge and you have to give them the opportunity to push themselves and they will always deliver results. This doesn’t account for everyone in government, though. On the other end of the spectrum, there are the ‘government lifers.’ They are the civil servants. They are the classic 9 to 5 &#8211; they clock in, clock out, they take lunch breaks. There are people who are very comfortable with this lifestyle. For them, it’s a lifestyle job. I respect them. They are working families; many of them have kids and cannot commit any extra hours outside of the 9 to 5. But sometimes what can be done in 24 hours can lead to 24 days. I think that’s a very typical picture of how government functions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">When coming to the government, you’re dealing with real-life situations, with real-life people. Consultants are people who are driven on their own. You don’t need to tell them what to do, they will run and go, versus in government, you really learn to manage people with a wide spectrum of motivations and incentives. Government is also very political &#8211; different people have different agendas. Government is a really great training ground for someone to understand political alliances, to understand managing different types of talent, while always delivering great results.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Lastly, there was a great sense that I was having a lot of impact when working for the government. If you implement your initiatives correctly, you will have direct impact on the city, not just the company or industry you are working with. When you are generating a billion dollars, you have just created tens of thousands of jobs&#8230;that’s really rewarding.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Given my past working experiences, I would put private sector somewhere between consulting and government. The people here at LivePerson have the same goal as consultants do, in terms of the for-profit aspect. It’s very clear we need to deliver results in terms of revenue and profit, and compensation and bonus act as the carrots you can play with to achieve those results. When in government, however, I learned that money isn’t the only option you can use to incentivize people and I learned different management techniques to do so. For these reasons, the transition has been good. The consulting skills never leave you. You come in, you know you’re not supposed to change everything, you listen, you build alliances, you get to know people. It has been a great time.</span></p>\n<p><em>What about your non-profit and government experience have you found to be translatable to your current roles at LivePerson?</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">I will say that some people often find it very hard to position me given my non-traditional path. When you come out of consulting, it is easier for people to think you’ll be Head of Strategy or Pricing or Analytics. When you throw in a not-for-profit government gig and say you want to come back to profit, how do you connect the dots? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">First, you really learn the process of making things happen in government. I think if you can make things work in government, you most likely can make things happen in the private sector. The bureaucracy, the politics&#8230;if you learn how to jump through all those hoops in government, it’s relatively easy in the private sector, especially for a company of 1,000 employees compared to 100,000 people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Second, in government, you learn that joining forces is very beneficial. Because of the structure in consulting, if you deliver, you get promoted. But in government, a lot of times the most networked individual in politics gets promoted. I think that realization is applicable to a private sector company&#8230; knowing that you can’t shine on your own and that you need to build the right support network within the company to advance your agenda and to make things happen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The last piece I mentioned was learning how to operationalize your strategy.</span> <span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> I learned to implement a ton of strategy in the government. During my tenure, I launched 40-50 initiatives and programs in New York City across different industries. It’s good to recommend a strategy, but you need to know how to actually implement the strategy when push comes to shove. That implementation and operational skill is very useful in any role. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">A career is made up of many building blocks. When you exit consulting, you have different building blocks built into your foundations &#8211; analytical skills, client management skills, or business development skills. When I graduated from consulting, I was a business leader and more on the strategy side. But when I went to work for the government, I got the people management, the shrewd business development, and the operational blocks. As you gain more experiences, you continue to build that house that is your career out of these different building blocks you acquire from each role. When I came to LivePerson, I brought with me my consulting toolkit and my knowledge of coming up with templates and coming up with strategy and process. I brought with me my government skills and the ways I learned to work with different people and to join forces and make things happen. I don’t see my path as traditional compared to most consultants, but I also don’t have difficulties articulating what I learned in each step of my journey and how that has helped me along the way.</span></p>\n<p><em>As both Chief of Staff and Global Head of People, can you describe the roles and how you balance between the two?</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">As a Chief of Staff, you truly are the right-hand to the CEO, his or her closest adviser, a partner in developing the vision and the strategy of the company. The CEO can come up with the vision, but the Chief of Staff is responsible for asking the tough questions: How you are going to do that? What are you going to do with sales? How is marketing going to generate leads? What are the customers like? How do you segment the market? What do customers really need? You help the CEO build the strategy to deliver. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">I originally hesitated to take the Head of People role because my background is in strategy and operations and my goal was to become a CEO or COO&#8230; to really run the organization. One day, my CEO told me, “There’s only two assets in a company &#8211; money and people. We trust the CFO with the money, we trust you with the people, and combining those two is what makes the company move forward.” When you manage people, you influence how we recruit and develop our talent, then you look at how these things fit into the strategic plans and the functional operation plan of the company. You are constantly playing a chess game when you are Head of People plus Chief of Staff. At LivePerson, I’m working with over a thousand people. How are you going to move them around? How are you going to manage the resources? How are you going to partner with the finance team so you can hit the revenue targets and the margins? People are the biggest expense in a tech company, so you become very mindful and start asking questions like, “What is the most cost effective way to service each of the customer segments?” Once you have that answer and strategy, then you start figuring out how you are going to move people, what you are going to move in-house and what you are going to outsource.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">I think a lot of CHROs say they want a seat at the table. As Chief of Staff, I happen to start with a seat at the table and I just put on a different hat. I know the agenda, I have a voice, and luckily our CEO also really cares a lot about the people and the culture. I am Chief of Staff, which involves thinking like a CEO and thinking about running a business and driving performance and high growth high returns. On the other side, you need to be the people person, you need to protect the people, you need to create the best environment to recruit and retain them. Often times that can be at odds. If you have an extra dollar to spend, do you spend that on R&amp;D development or do you spend it on a wellness program? How do you balance that? But the sky’s the limit with my combined business strategy and people role, so I try to combine them.</span></p>\n<p><em>As an executive search firm, we have observed an increasing number of organizations looking to recruit former consultants for executive HR roles. Despite this trend, many current and former consultants don’t consider taking on such roles down the line because they don’t view HR as the function for them. As LivePerson’s Global Head of People and a former Junior Partner at Oliver Wyman, how did you bridge the gap between consultant and people person?</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">As a strategy consultant, if you decide to pursue the people path you have to ask yourself if you are really truly passionate about people. I have no HR background, absolutely zero. But I came from two organizations that have good talent management strategy….management consulting is known for its very rigorous onboarding process, very rigorous recruiting process and very rigorous review assessment process. Even though I don’t have the HR background, I know what should be the right outcome or the wrong outcome. I know that my consulting background lends me the business intelligence that most HR professionals struggle with, so the combination of consulting and HR can be powerful.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">But as a former consultant, you then must see if you can bridge the gap between business and people because often times they can be at odds. This year, one of the tools we used was an engagement survey. If you do a traditional HR engagement survey, you’ll find out that people are either happy or not happy. I didn’t want to just find out whether my people are happy or not happy &#8211; what they are happy and not happy about is what truly matters. We were able to do some analysis of the responses to really figure out what matters to our talent at LivePerson. When we think about what makes people happy, usually what first comes up is work-life balance. The survey data surprisingly told us that work-life balance is one of the bottom five things that matter to our employees. That’s an example where the strategy/business/consulting mindset comes in. We are very data-driven, we’re trained to be data-driven. When a team member tries to propose a different program, the consultant will always go back to the survey. The people side forces you to think differently because you know that the data doesn’t always tell you the full story. For example, you know there are other things that affect the workplace, like management. Without good management you can’t deliver good results in a lot of other areas and this knowledge doesn’t come across in a survey. That is when your people knowledge needs to kick in to make connections outside the data to figure out what really matters to your team and employees. </span></p>\n<p><em>There has been a lot of discussion recently on the composition of the corporate workforce, especially in the tech industry. As a female of Southeast Asian origins, what have your experiences been like in the industry and how do you see yourself participating in these conversations?</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">I’m currently a member of the Women in Power fellowship program at the 92nd Street Y, which gives me a lot of perspective about gender diversity and women in business because I’ve been very active in conversations about these issues. I know I would love to participate more in the discussion on diversity in the workplace.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">I used to say lack of diversity was the consequence of the supply of talent &#8211; everyone starts with the source. For example, there isn’t enough female talent in tech because of the supply of talent from engineering schools, which obviously skews the demographics in an organization. As a mom with two kids, I think marriage and childbirth also have a strong influence in what women desire to do. Is there a women’s issue? Yes, there’s obviously a smaller network of women in the high-tech industry. And in terms of racial and ethnic diversity, they’re still mostly white men at the top of the tree. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">In addition to focusing on the sources of these issues, I think we should focus on what will make things easier for women to be successful, to make companies more welcoming or make the idea of working in a tech company more welcoming to women. You might not have that many female developers, but that doesn’t mean you can’t have more women sales people, marketing people, etc. I also believe that tech companies can do a better job in recruitment by inserting more women into that process. I’m not saying we set a quota to hire ‘X’ number of women each year, but we can have more female interviewers in the process that will provide a different perspective as we bring in different candidates to try and neutralize a more or less male-dominated environment. I actually do believe that the recruiting process is more objective in the tech industry than you would think if you look at other industries. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Here at LivePerson, we aren’t perfect, but we are definitely trying. I want to believe that if you are a good engineer and a good developer that people will look past whatever color you are, whatever gender you are. These aren’t things engineers and developers care about in the recruiting process. They just want to find the best talent to join the team. </span></p>\n<p><em>How do you see LivePerson highlighting diversity &amp; inclusion as a priority?</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">We have a really open workspace where we try to accommodate all our talent. In Israel, where family is very important culturally, this week we have a summer camp going on in the office open to all the children of our employees &#8211; I’m talking about hundreds of kids. In Israel, there are two weeks before school starts where summer camp ends and parents end up taking vacation to take care of the kids. So two or three years ago, our people group decided to put together a summer camp in the office: 16 different conference rooms filled with hundreds of kids for summer camp at our Tel Aviv office, which has 400+ employees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Fundamentally, I don’t think that we should only focus on women, we need to also focus on families. It can be same-sex families, heterosexual families, but when you build an environment and a company that is open to and supportive of families, I think that goes a long way. You can’t just support the wife and not the husband.  In different offices, we do different things. In New York, the demographic is still quite young. We had a summer party, went to a restaurant, basically just drinks and food for an afternoon to socialize and connect with coworkers. In Atlanta, which is our second largest office globally, we’ve been doing tailgates, a family funday tailgate where they have screens indoors showing college football and outdoor space for kids to run around and tailgate cookout that people can enjoy. I believe employers need to be more open-minded to develop their people strategy by understanding who their talent is and then go from there. </span></p>\n<p><em>LivePerson has gone through various shifts since you joined the company in 2012. Do you see the changes as part of a turnaround effort?</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">I do. And we aren’t done yet&#8230;we’re still turning. If you look at chat, it’s basically all about capturing the traffic on your website. If you look at the late 1990s, everyone’s trying to get online, people are busy setting up their websites, and gradually when you have a good website, you set up e-commerce, then set up an automatic support site, then we found we needed a way to communicate with our users, so chat was created. If you look at a majority of brands nowadays, everybody has chat. Our CEO had the foresight to know that chat was going to one day be a commoditized product and that it wasn’t going to be as profitable as before and that’s absolutely true. When we realized the messaging business was being commoditized we made another realization: people were shifting from website-desktop to a mobile phone. We saw that this was the future and it’s so exciting that we aren’t just competing for your time on a website; we are competing for your time on your mobile device. No one wants to call 1-800 numbers anymore. It is the most annoying thing in the world! What if you have the option to message the brand instead of calling them? The message will come from your phone and you won’t be tied to your desk during your lunch break trying to fix your bill and chatting with an agent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">So in 2012 we started to replatform&#8230;I would consider this a type of turnaround case. When you replatform you essentially create a product that will kill your own product. Our CEO basically asked us, “What would you do to kill LivePerson right now?” We built a new product, replatformed in a way that would enable messaging and became more open so that we can have an API to have more partners hook into it. It’s a different way of connecting with consumers. We were no longer a growth company and instead became an investment company. We invested three years, I’m talking about tens of millions of human resources in this new platform. Very few software companies have gone through a replatforming initiative and successfully emerged on the other side and continued to grow. We are currently moving our customers to the new platform and haven’t had one customer who said he/she won’t move. Their concerns are about, for example, having round corners versus sharp corners. You explain to the customer that round corners aren’t important, what is important is taking part in messaging that is the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">I truly believe this company will make it through this journey. Our deal size will increase; our usage will increase as soon as people download the new package. We now sell multimillion-dollar deals because the traffic on phone calls is insane. That is a multi-billion, maybe trillion dollar call center market we are breaking into. So if LivePerson is successful in disrupting the voice market, this is not just a 250 million-dollar business anymore&#8230; this will be much bigger. I think in 12 months we’ll have a better story about how Live Person successfully turned around or perhaps pivoted to go from being a chat company to a messaging company.</span></p>\n<p><em>Since you joined, LivePerson has grown from 6 to 13 offices, increased by 500 employees and established a presence in 21 countries. How have you prepared for and navigated these on-going changes within your own role?</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">As the company continues to transform, we are continuing to fine-tune the engine. The challenge, I think, as a truly global company is culturally. When I say culture, this is me combining my Chief of Staff and people role. You’re not doing culture for the sake of doing culture. I think that’s one of the biggest mistakes in people strategy, the notion that culture is to make people feel good, to make it fun. I am a business person. I believe culture is what the company needs, yes to drive retention and engagement, but ultimately as a for-profit organization, culture is going to drive performance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">As the company continues to grow globally, there are employees I won’t be able to interact with personally, so I think optimizing the system without complicating things becomes more important. You need to be standardized, you need to be globalized and if you can put in a simple-to-use system to make info more transparent, more real time, that’s absolutely important. As companies continue to grow those are things you need to start thinking about. If you only have four or five offices, then logistical issues are easier to deal with. But when you are a company of 13 offices, how do you go about organizing a global town hall when there is no one time zone that works for everyone? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">As a business leader, you make tough choices. There are certain regions that are a higher priority because they are a more critical mass of employees or there are certain regions where you will actually put an HR person there. But how do you leverage that person so they serve their region and the global culture? You can’t just create two different teams, in terms of location, that are exact replicas of each other. That’s not going to drive skills, that’s not going to drive efficiency and it’s not healthy because the teams are doing their own thing based on what they know about demographics in that region. So I needed to globalize the team and my different people leaders constantly need to be on the same page and have a comprehensive view of working together globally and making the people strategy work. I would say that’s the challenge we have as we continue to grow&#8230;figuring out how we scale culture, how we use culture to scale the business, how we stay transparent, consistent, global, but not too rigid because each region is still different.</span></p>\n<p><em>Inside and outside of the office, you wear many hats. What is your recipe for successfully managing the different role in your life?</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">If you talk to my staff, they will tell you I’m quite zen and I think that’s part of what you need to do when you’re wearing all these hats. Nothing really stresses me out because I know my capabilities. I know if I’m committed to doing something I’ll get it done. I know what resources I have at work and in my personal life. I think when you wear multiple hats; the key is your own confidence. If you’re constantly worried you might get fired, you’re probably in the wrong job, in the wrong role, in the wrong company.</span> <span style=\"font-weight:400;\">I’m very fortunate that I have a really trusting relationship with my boss. That’s one thing I know that will keep me here, but not necessarily the only thing. I’m the owner of the business and everything I do is to do the best thing for the business. My trusting relationship with my CEO is one of the reasons I believe he hired me. I’m going to tell him exactly what I think is right for the business. If I challenge him or disagree with him I tell him exactly what I think and I’m not fearful that I’m going to get fired. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">I have a very healthy family, I have a great partner and husband. It’s absolutely important to have that as a career woman. I know I’m not a multimillionaire like Sheryl Sandberg, but there’s a thousandaire in me that will make it work. I think women executives if you decide you want to have a career; you need to have a good husband, a good partner who is in it with you. I have a trusting partner that will be able to do that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">How do I decompress? I always meditate. It’s not just because of my job, I’ve been doing this for the past 20+ years. You naturally breathe and naturally decompress and you don’t need the yoga mat and therapy session to meditate. You can meditate in the subway; you can meditate in the shower. Even just one minute, ten seconds… there are things you can do to calm yourself down. I think that’s most important. I’ve seen very senior people, men and women, crash because they don’t find a state of calmness. I sleep well every night and I think that’s very important.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">All of this helps me stay chill. Yes, I have some stressful moments here and there. Overall, life is a learning opportunity. I will work my very best, give it all to be successful, give it all to deliver results. What if you fail? What if you make a mistake? What if you didn’t deliver exactly what you thought you could deliver?

In light of recent news stories and the McKinsey/LeanIn study, we argued the talent is available but companies need to do a better job recruiting women into leadership roles.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>\n<p>“It’s no secret that female leadership, or even representation, is severely lacking when it comes to the tech space. Diversity at the senior-most levels is top of mind for us and our clients, and we partner with organizations to ensure they have a talented, diverse leadership team to promote this approach to the rest of the organization,” says Alison Hunter, Vice President of Raines International. “It’s an issue that needs to be attacked from both the top and the bottom, and there is a lot of work left to do.&#8221; Read &#8220;<a href=\"https://rainesinternational.wordpress.com/2016/09/30/gender-parity-in-c-suite-shouldnt-take-100-years-the-talent-is-there-and-companies-need-to-lead/\">Gender Parity in C-Suite shouldn&#8217;t take 100 years. The talent is there and companies need to lead.</a>&#8221;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2. Harvard Business Review looked at what skills and actions help CEOs become more effective. &#8220;The best CEOs focus primarily on four things: communication, communication, communication, and overseeing resource allocation to ensure that the priorities they’re communicating are actually the ones getting funded,&#8221; HBR&#8217;s James Allen wrote</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allen recommended CEOs &#8220;ruthlessly protect your time,&#8221; avoid getting caught up in office politics and over-managing, boil strategy down to a few key points that everyone in the company knows, and praise those who are executing the CEOs strategy.

The Wall Street Journal&#8217;s Joann S. Lublin pointed to the significant career gains many executives see after signing on to work on or with a nonprofit board. &#8220;Nonprofit board experience can help senior managers strengthen their leadership skills and connections with high-powered players,&#8221; she explains. While many positions are unpaid, if executives put in time and effort to their role, they may see new job opportunities and connections.

And of course, in the travel business world, the completion  of the merger of Starwood and Marriott chains has earned a lot of attention. The Economist looked at some of the strategic issues that come with the merger, including a lack of competition and the changes to loyalty programs, which affects customer retention.

      "content": "<p><b>By <a href=\"http://rainesinternational.com/paul-a.-p.-rodney.html\">Pauly Rodney</a></b></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The NBA made a $100 million decision this summer when it moved the 2017 NBA All-Star Weekend out of Charlotte, NC.  The game relocation came after the state passed HB2, referred as the “Bathroom Bill,” which did far more than dictate which bathrooms North Carolinians should use.  The far-reaching bill eliminated anti-discrimination protections for LGBTQ individuals in the state and also stopped local municipalities from creating their own anti-discrimination policies.  By moving All-Star Weekend, the league showed a commitment to inclusion, led other leagues to do the same, and encouraged a wave of companies using their power of the purse to hold partners accountable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The NBA has long touted its commitment to diversity: 81% of its players, 47% of its head coaches, and 36% of its league office staff </span><a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/diversity-in-the-nba-the-nfl-and-mlb/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">are racially or ethnically diverse</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. The league office and its teams also have a number of LGBTQ staff. The NBA is also proud of its record on, and commitment to, inclusion.  They were the first major sports league with an openly gay athlete, Brooklyn Nets player Jason Collins, who </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"><a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/allstar/2016/07/21/nba-to-move-all-star-game-charlotte-anti-lgbt-bill/87395090/\">said</a> </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">he is “extremely proud” of the NBA’s decision to move the game. “</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Their decision is an extremely poignant one and shows that discrimination of any kind is not welcome in sports and is not acceptable in any part of our society,” Collins </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"><a href=\"http://www.wcsh6.com/sports/nba-moving-2017-all-star-game-from-charlotte-due-to-anti-lgbt-bill/279276050\">said</a> </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">to</span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> USA Today. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">“The NBA has set the best kind of example and precedent moving forward for all to follow.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Openly gay NBA executive Rick Welts, the President and COO of the Golden State Warriors, had a key role not only in the </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"><a href=\"https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=rick%20welts%20creation%20all%20star%20weekend\">creation of All-Star Weekend in 1980</a> </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">but also in inspiring the move from Charlotte. Through international exhibitions and his work on the 1992 Dream Team, Welts helped bring NBA basketball to an international audience. Welts, who has worked in the NBA for decades, began as a ballboy, worked his way up through the league office, and is among the most respected and accomplished executives in sports.  Welts </span><a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2016/07/22/golden-state-warriors-executive-influenced-nbas-2017-charlotte-all-star-game/87458518/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">told </span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">other NBA leaders that he and others wouldn’t feel comfortable attending All-Star Weekend in Charlotte because of the state’s controversial law.  If Welts and many like him were not comfortable attending All-Star Weekend, keeping it in Charlotte would have been tone-deaf.  Despite possibly investing millions in marketing, travel, and through its partners &#8211; the league relocated All-Star Weekend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">By taking a stand against LGBTQ discrimination, the NBA builds its position as a leader in the fight for diversity in the sports industry. ESPN </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/17120170/nba-moving-all-star-game-charlotte-north-carolina-bill\">stood</a> </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">with the NBA’s decision, noting its own support of inclusion.  Weeks after the NBA’s progressive decision, the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) announced it is </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"><a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/2016/09/12/ncaa-to-relocate-championship-events-north-carolina-house-bill-2/90284584/\">moving</a> </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">seven championship games out of North Carolina, including the opening rounds of the 2017 Division I Men’s Basketball Tournament, part of March Madness.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Days later, the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) joined the NCAA in </span><a href=\"http://collegebasketball.nbcsports.com/2016/09/14/the-acc-to-remove-neutral-site-championships-from-north-carolina-due-to-hb2/?cid=eref:nbcnews:text\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">relocating</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> all neutral-site championships this season.  These organizations all stand to lose money they have already invested and risked upsetting partners who have committed to spending big on the events. But, their decision was made much easier by the NBA being first out of the gate, and giving the others cover to announce similar decisions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">As NBA Commissioner Adam Silver put it, this </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"><a href=\"http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/business/article96628947.html\">was</a> </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">a business decision, but it was also a safe bet.  Charlotte officials estimate the economic impact of losing the All-Star Weekend could be around $100 million.  Though some costs are not recoverable, the cost of doing nothing could have been much greater. Not only would the NBA’s reputation be on the line, but cheerful photos of the NBA/WNBA/NBDL athletes may have been replaced on front pages by community protests.  Indeed, there is a good chance that the NBA’s own players and staff would have participated in thoughtful protests. Instead, the NBA has received positive press with players and staff praising the league&#8217;s decision in earned media.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The NBA league said it is trying to effect “positive change” with its decision.  Perhaps the league will do more than just get good press and highlight its own core values of “not only diversity, inclusion, fairness and respect for others, but also the willingness to listen and consider opposing points of views.” Perhaps the NBA will spur other corporations to use their power of the purse to influence agencies, suppliers, and partners.  Perhaps the NBA will remind everyone of the true point of All-Star weekend &#8211; athletes and teams putting aside their differences to come together, embrace the community, and put teamwork and a love of the game above all else.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Perhaps.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://rainesinternational.com/paul-a.-p.-rodney.html\">Pauly Rodney</a> is Vice President, Raines International, and co-head of the firm&#8217;s Diversity &amp; Inclusion Practice. </em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "short_URL": "http://wp.me/p7C5yw-2nV",
      "content": "<hr />\n<p>This week&#8217;s study on women and tech and the recent discussion of the lack of diversity in advertising make it clear that no companies have taken a full leadership position in diversifying ranks. While there&#8217;s certainly not parity, there is sufficient talent available, based on the McKinsey and LeanIn study, published in the Wall Street Journal this week.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s this mean? If any company wants to take a leadership position, that company can be a market leader, put their money behind promises of diversity and inclusion.</p>\n<p>So far all we&#8217;ve seen are quick patchwork solutions proffered by others, like John Greathouse, a California-based venture capitalist, who suggested in a<em> Wall Street Journal </em><a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2016/09/28/why-women-in-tech-might-consider-just-using-their-initials-online/\">article</a> that women in tech essentially hide their gender online.  Greenhouse <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johngreathouse/status/781584645691289600\">ended up</a> apologizing for his article the day after publication, acknowledging he &#8220;told women to endure the gender bias problem rather than acting to fix the problem.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Greenhouse is right &#8211; gender bias is a very real issue.  Critics, however, are also right when they say that he didn&#8217;t provide any ways to actually counter the problem.</p>\n<p>As an executive search firm filling positions in the C-suite, we think there&#8217;s clear evidence it shouldn&#8217;t take 100 years to reach gender parity in the C-suite, as<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/caroline-turner/gender-parity-a-realistic_b_9065928.html\"> some studies have said.</a> The talent is there; unfortunately, most companies aren&#8217;t utilizing what&#8217;s right in front of them. LeanIn/McKinsey&#8217;s study found &#8220;corporate America promotes men at 30% higher rates than women during their early career stages, and that entry-level women are significantly more likely than men to have spent five or more years in the same role.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While women make up nearly half (46%) of entry-level positions, and 37% of managerial and 33% of director positions, the numbers continue to drop the higher the position. Only 29% of vice presidents are women and only 24% are senior vice presidents. By the time we&#8217;re in the C-suite, only 19% are women.</p>\n<p>With a strong and growing bench of talent, leading companies should seize this data and use it to hold themselves accountable. If in ten years, it seems companies haven&#8217;t moved the flag significantly closer toward parity, then it&#8217;s clear current executives are just tossing out buzzwords instead of solutions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s no secret that female leadership, or even representation, is severely lacking when it comes to the tech space. Diversity at the senior-most levels is top of mind for us and our clients, and we partner with organizations to ensure they have a talented, diverse leadership team to promote this approach to the rest of the organization,&#8221; says Alison Hunter, Vice President of Raines International. &#8220;It’s an issue that needs to be attacked from both the top and the bottom, and there is a lot of work left to do.&#8221;</p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n",

      "content": "<hr />\n<p>The traditional job hunt emphasizes the importance of hard skills when pursuing a particular career, whether it is knowing how to use certain programs or having the expertise needed to complete the duties of the role. In the world of increased competition and with higher stakes on the line, however, the importance of soft skills can’t be understated. Companies are spending more than ever on recruiting efforts in order to find and attract employees with certain essential core values that improve productivity.</p>\n<p>“Employers are increasingly looking for workers with strong soft skills—those traits that don’t show up in a job posting but are essential for succeeding in the workplace, like working well with others and taking initiative,” the Wall Street Journal’s Kate Davidson <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/employers-find-soft-skills-like-critical-thinking-in-short-supply-1472549400\">reports</a>. When reading a position description, soft skills refer to the personable traits that enable an individual to work harmoniously and effectively with other people. As revealed in a <a href=\"https://blog.linkedin.com/2016/01/12/the-25-skills-that-can-get-you-hired-in-2016?trk=li_corpblog_corp_softskills\">Linkedin study</a> this year, the most in-demand soft skills include communication, organization, teamwork and punctuality.</p>\n<p>“In a Wall Street Journal survey of nearly 900 executives last year, 92% said soft skills were equally important or more important than technical skills,” she writes. “But 89% said they have a very or somewhat difficult time finding people with the requisite attributes.”</p>\n<p>At Inc.com, Lou Adler <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/lou-adler/hiring-guide-soft-skills.html\">argues</a>, “People don’t under-perform because they lack technical skills. People under-perform because they lack soft skills.” After all, you can train or teach employees certain skills for how to do a job, but you cannot teach soft skills, which help employees excel in any industry, any function and any position. “In pursuit of the ideal employee, companies are investing more time and capital in teasing out job applicants’ personality quirks, sometimes hiring consultants to develop tests or other screening methods,” the Journal reports.</p>\n<p>Joshua Zigman, a Managing Director at executive search firm Raines International, highlights just how integral soft skill evaluation is within the recruitment process.</p>\n<p>“We at Raines spend a considerable amount of time evaluating a candidate’s soft skills. By the time we are actually interviewing candidates, we know they are technically qualified for the role. So in reality, almost all of the interviewing process focuses on assessing soft skills, especially executive presence and communication skills.”</p>\n<p>Sometimes clients explicitly state what soft skills they need in a potential hire, displaying them alongside technical and hard skills on a position description. As trusted advisers to their clients, sometimes search professionals need to be “ahead of the curve to determine what would make a candidate a good fit so we ensure a long-term, quality hire,” explains Zigman.</p>\n<p>So how do search professionals and hiring managers assess soft skills? The Omnia Group <a href=\"http://www.omniagroup.com/identify-candidates-soft-skills/\">recommends</a> asking specific interview questions to candidates. The World Bank <a href=\"http://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/hard-measurement-soft-skills\">suggests</a> role-playing exercises and skills-based interviews.</p>\n<p>“At Raines International,” says Zigman, “we specifically take note of how a candidate handles him or herself throughout every stage of the interview process, from the first point of contact through offer negotiations. How does the candidate interact with our Search Coordinators and administrative team? Are they quick to be frustrated by changing logistics or schedules? How do they process feedback? All these interactions shed light on how the candidate is going to perform on an interpersonal level when working with the client.”</p>\n<p>It is important to note, that while soft skills are popping up on position descriptions and are increasingly seen as crucial to making a good hire, there is no perfect set of soft skills that will land you any job.</p>\n<p>“Because we deal with such a diverse set of clients, Raines knows that not one style of candidate or set of soft skills fits every company,” Zigman explains. “Some companies require a more collaborative team, so they will emphasize communication and problem-solving skills. But others need candidates with thicker skin who can work independently.”</p>\n<p>While each company has a different formula for the combination of hard and soft skills to make a winning hire, one thing remains clear: soft skills matter. “At the end of the day,” Zigman concludes, “fit and soft skills close the deal and get a company excited about a person.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<hr />\n<p>At Raines International, we constantly and consistently advocate for diversity and inclusion. Diversity efforts are well-documented as boosting the bottom line, staff morale, and creativity &amp; innovation. Despite these visible benefits, a lot of work <a href=\"http://consultanttrack.com/reading-july-8/#.V6aH4-grKDs\">needs to be done</a> to balance gender and racial diversity in the advertising world.</p>\n<p>Publicis Groupe executive and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Chairman Kevin Roberts got into hot water this week when he <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/kevin-roberts-on-women-in-leadership-roles-2016-7\">told Business Insider</a> he doesn&#8217;t think there are any gender diversity problems in advertising and hence doesn&#8217;t spend &#8220;any time&#8221; on gender-related issues within his companies.</p>\n<p>When looking to make sense of the lack of female representation in the industry, Roberts suggested that women don&#8217;t want to be in the C-suite and instead just want to be happy. &#8220;Their ambition is not a vertical ambition,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;It&#8217;s this intrinsic, circular ambition to be happy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Roberts continued, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think [the lack of women in leadership roles] is a problem. I&#8217;m just not worried about it because they are very happy, they&#8217;re very successful and doing great work. I can&#8217;t talk about sexual discrimination because we&#8217;ve never had that problem, thank goodness.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Roberts isn&#8217;t alone in his assumptions. The advertising industry needs to take serious steps to increase diversity because right now it&#8217;s flunking the diversity test. “I don’t think we’re in a good place at all,” Carolyn Everson, <a class=\"company-name\" href=\"http://quotes.wsj.com/FB\">Facebook</a>’s Vice President of Global Marketing Solutions, told the Wall Street Journal earlier this year at the American Association of Advertising Agencies&#8217;s Conference in Miami.</p>\n<p>Supporting Carolyn&#8217;s claim, the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Current Population Survey <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-picture-of-diversity-on-madison-avenue-is-so-murky-1458332278\">found</a> paltry diversity numbers in the composition of the advertising and public relations industries, let alone in the top executive roles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>49% Women</li>\n<li>5.3% African American</li>\n<li>11.7% Hispanics</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rounding out these bits of incriminating evidence, J. Walter Thompson (the fourth-largest ad agency in the world) CEO Gustvao Martinez <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/diversity-in-advertising-sparks-heated-discussions-at-industry-conference-1458747430\">resigned</a> earlier this year after being accused of racism and sexism. While Martinez denied the claims, he and J. Walter Thompson were sued for an “unending stream of racist and sexist comments as well as unwanted touching and other unlawful conduct.”</p>\n<p>Roberts&#8217; feelings aren&#8217;t shared by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and Publicis, however. Shortly after his comments went public, he was put on leave July 31, and the company emphasized its commitment to diversity and inclusion. (Just a few days later, Roberts took himself out of the picture and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/04/business/media/publicis-executive-kevin-roberts-is-out-after-gender-diversity-remarks.html?_r=0\">told</a> the New York Times he is leaving Publicis Sept. 1. Roberts said he miscommunicated and apologized.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;Diversity and inclusion are business imperatives on which Publicis Groupe will not negotiate,&#8221; Publicis said in a statement. &#8220;While fostering a work environment that is inclusive of all talent is a collective responsibility, it is leadership’s job to nurture the career aspirations and goals of all our talent.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Publicis doubled down, saying it believes &#8220;promoting gender equality starts at the top.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Publicis Groupe works very hard to champion diversity and will continue to insist that each agency’s leadership be champions of both diversity and inclusion,&#8221; the statement ends. We can only hope that other companies will soon begin to do the same.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<hr />\n<p>It&#8217;s a good time to be a consultant in the United States &#8212; the consulting market is booming.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/cfos-turn-to-consultants-as-challenges-mount-1469468219\">According</a> to the Wall Street Journal&#8217;s Tatyana Shumsky, more and more U.S. corporations &#8212; Chief Financial Officers specifically &#8212; are hiring outside consultants to help grow revenue and tackle the increasingly complex set of problems and opportunities facing companies today.</p>\n<p>And the statistics back it up.  Market research firm Source Global Research, which focuses on large and midsize consultants, found that the U.S. consulting market is now a $55 billion industry.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The U.S. consulting market, the world&#8217;s largest, grew by $3.9 billion, or 7.7%, in 2015 to $54.7 billion, according to Source Global Research,&#8221; the Wall Street Journal reported. But that&#8217;s not it. Source Global Research projects a 10% increase in 2016.</p>\n<p>To what is the growth attributed? Fast-paced technological innovation, increased regulation and new competition are among the factors, according to consultants and market researchers.</p>\n<p>That said, there&#8217;s a fine line between using consultants to do work executives should know how to and having consultants supplement executive actions.  AlixPartners LLP&#8217;s Senior Vice Chairman Fred Crawford suggests the best time for consultants is when a company requires &#8220;a surge of qualified, capable people that you need for a period of time but not forever.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Executive search firm Raines International, however, says otherwise. The New York-based firm is witnessing a growing trend of hiring consultants across industries and functions, highlighting the growing importance of securing a consulting background in their leadership teams. In 2015, the company experienced a 15% increase in the number of consultants it placed in industry roles over the last five years. In addition, an increasingly large set of the firm&#8217;s clients specifically request hiring individuals with a management consulting background.</p>\n<p>“We’ve seen a large expansion in the functional breadth of client needs with regards to current or former consultant talent,&#8221; said Alison Hunter, a Core Member of Raines&#8217; Strategy Practice.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;With Raines’ long-standing and extensive work with the consulting community, we have certainly witnessed a growing variety in the ways a current or former consultant can make an impact in an organization than there was previously. From top finance jobs to transformative human resources roles, our clients are increasingly looking for individuals with a strong skillset from an external consulting firm to lead innovation and to drive change and growth within many different areas of a company. ”</p></blockquote>\n<p>The growth of the consulting industry over the past year signals the increasing value leaders across industries place on the management consulting acumen. While many still see consultants as a temporary fix to their business concerns, the increasingly complex set of obstacles and opportunities business leaders face today are leading many to hire consultants as permanent members of their leadership teams. In any case, it sure is a good time to be a consultant.</p>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"http://www.sourceglobalresearch.com/report/download/1284/extract/0/The-US-Consulting-Market\">extract for the Source Global Research report.</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

USA Today&#8217;s Jessica Guynn reported Facebook has long way to go with its diversity efforts. &#8220;Hispanics represent 4% and African Americans 2% of Facebook&#8217;s U.S. workers, percentages that have not budged since 2014 and that fall below other industries&#8217; averages,&#8221; Guynn reported. &#8220;Facebook has made slightly more progress on gender diversity, yet nearly seven out of 10 employees around the globe are men.&#8221;</p>\n<p>To broaden its hiring pool moving forward, Facebook plans to add unconscious bias training, expand its Facebook University training, and invest in online programs. Read <strong><a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/07/14/facebook-makes-scant-progress-diversity/87059202/\">&#8220;Facebook makes scant progress on diversity.</a>&#8221; </strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2. Harvard Business Review&#8217;s Alison Beard pointed to a recent survey that found CEOs who diverge from their company&#8217;s culture had more successful companies. One of the researchers, Arizona State University&#8217;s Angelo Kinicki explained that the research &#8220;shows that a CEO’s style should complement the company’s culture, so he or she provides something the culture doesn’t.&#8221; What does that mean?</p>\n<p>&#8220;If your company is already very relationship focused—emphasizing collaboration, shared decision making, and interpersonal support—a leader with the same orientation would be redundant,&#8221; Kinicki says. &#8220;What you really need is someone who will set expectations, clarify rules, and push people to get things done. And the reverse is also true: If your company is results oriented, it needs a CEO who is good at building relationships.&#8221; Read<strong> <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/07/ceos-shouldnt-try-to-embody-their-firms-culture?utm_content=buffereb0fe&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\">&#8220;CEOS shouldn&#8217;t try to embody their firms&#8217; culture&#8221;</a> </strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3. &#8220;Chief executives tap consultants, expert prognostications and polls about market and political conditions to help inform business decisions,&#8221; The Wall Street Journal&#8217;s Rachel Emma Silverman, Joann S. Lublin and Rachel Feintzeig reported. &#8220;But from <a class=\"icon none\" href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/brexit-breaking-up-amicably-is-hard-to-do-1468174530\">the Brexit surprise</a> to the rise of <a href=\"http://topics.wsj.com/person/T/Donald-Trump/159\">Donald Trump</a> and the frequently revised U.S. job market numbers, expert analyses have been landing far off the mark—and executives are growing wary.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The trio talked to a few CEOs about their reliance on such forecasting tools moving forward. Read <strong>&#8220;<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/in-uncertain-times-ceos-lose-faith-in-forecasts-1468315801\">In Uncertain Times, CEOs lose Faith in Forecasts</a>&#8220;</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4.  Jeff Boss listed a few tips to help leaders help their teams including. &#8220;Invest in others and invest in yourself.&#8221; &#8220;People drive culture, culture drives performance.&#8221; &#8220;Over communicate or under deliver.&#8221;  Read <strong>&#8220;<a href=\"http://&quot; http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffboss/2016/07/01/7-leadership-truths-that-are-simple-in-concept-but-not-so-simple-to-live/#286789f165fe\">7 Leadership Truths that are Simple in Concept, but not so simple to live.&#8221;</a></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5.

      "content": "<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>Diversity isn&#8217;t just a buzzword &#8211; it&#8217;s an important factor in business development and long-term success. With the increasingly important role of diversity within the workplace, we highlight some recent findings on the importance of board diversity and why executive leadership teams from companies big and small should be thinking about it.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">In the 1980s, independence and concerns over whether a &#8220;board [was] truly independent of management&#8221; were the primary issues within corporate board development,&#8221; Howard Sherman, Executive Director and Head of Corporate Governance Business Development for MSCI ESG Research, told Forbes recently. &#8220;Some believed that there were ties that might cloud the board’s objectivity,&#8221; he explains, &#8220;therefore lessening their resolve when it came to overseeing management on behalf of the shareholders.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Today, however, diversity has emerged as corporate America’s primary concern. &#8220;A focus on whether the board has the right mix of talent is now a major consideration,&#8221; Sherman said. &#8220;This is a very healthy development, and companies are responding.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;A diverse workforce helps us better understand and address the needs of our customers,&#8221; adds TIAA&#8217;s CEO and Alphabet board member, Roger Ferguson.  &#8220;It brings a range of experiences and perspectives to the table, which leads to more innovative thinking and better problem-solving.”</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2015/12/06/why-diversity-and-inclusion-will-be-a-top-priority-for-2016/#1b567b2a4bd4\">While various studies</a> have cited a strong correlation between board diversity and increased financial returns, the question over board diversity and performance doesn&#8217;t stop there. Sherman explained:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The real question is whether this is correlation or causation: does having a significant number of women in leadership positions lead to better outcomes? Or, do companies with relatively good governance see board diversity as a natural extension of how they already operate? Either way, board and senior management diversity is becoming an interesting investment signal for investors attuned to the issue.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>At Raines International, we advocate strongly for increased diversity and the contributions it makes to understanding different<span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> opportunities, solving problems in a changing marketplace, and fostering better decision-making. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Strategic clients such as PepsiCo, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Boeing have recruited and groomed high performing women and people of color into executive roles,&#8221; said Pauly Rodney, Vice President and co-head of Raines International&#8217;s Diversity &amp; Inclusion Practice. &#8220;The bench of diverse Board candidates is deeper now than it has ever been.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Despite the potential for a high return on investment and a growing pool of diverse talent, corporate America might not see equal diversity on boards until the 2050s. “At this rate, the GAO [Government Accountability Office] has estimated that it could take more than 40 years for women’s representation on boards to be on par with men’s,” Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Jo White has said. With the current state of the United States&#8217; top performing companies, this fact isn&#8217;t too difficult to believe.</p>\n<p>Last month, we reported Catalyst&#8217;s findings on board diversity, which <a href=\"http://consultanttrack.com/annual-diversity-report-women-business-women-still-underrepresented/#.V4Uxf7grK00\">highlighted</a> how underrepresented women are on boards.  In May, Twitter <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/16/technology/twitter-board-debra-lee/?iid=EL\">appointed</a> Debra Lee as its first African-American board member. Twitter isn&#8217;t alone, though. In April, <a href=\"https://newsroom.uber.com/ariannahuffington/\">Uber brought on</a> Huffington Post founder and editor-in-chief Arianna Huffington as its first female board member and Google&#8217;s parent company Alphabet <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/29/technology/alphabet-board-diversity/\">only recently appointed</a> its first African-American board member, Roger Ferguson, after missing its mark when its 2015 diversity statistics found only 2% of staff were African-Americans.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Alphabet added a brilliant and well-respected executive to their Board,&#8221; adds Rodney. &#8220;The fact that this is also a person of color sends a message to other Boards &#8211; diverse candidates exist, companies just need to hire them.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>As a result, the SEC&#8217;s White is calling for more firms to reveal the diversity on their boards, <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-drafting-rule-requiring-firms-reveal-board-diversity-1467078153\">according</a> to the Wall Street Journal. “The low level of board diversity in the United States is unacceptable,” White said at the International Corporate Governance Network. “Our lens of board diversity disclosure needs to be refocused in order to better serve and inform investors.”</p>\n<p>Within the ongoing conversation on board diversity, Roger Ferguson <a href=\"http://www.diversityinc.com/tiaa-cref-2015/\">makes one thing clear</a>: board diversity is no longer &#8220;just nice to have. It&#8217;s a must.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

impressive 61% of consultants saw an increase in their base and bonus compared to compensation at consulting firms. This is up from 37% as found in our 2012 study. When factoring in equity, sign-on and relocation bonuses, however, overall compensation increased for a staggering 89% of recruited consultants, up from 77% as found in our previous study. Only 11% saw decreases in their total compensation, a factor mitigated by significant decreases in their cost of living as a result of relocation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/consultanttrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/6-and-7-combines.jpg\" alt=\"6 and 7 combines\" /></p>\n<p>Additionally, the findings show that a majority of consultants took an increase in both their base and bonus and in total compensation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/consultanttrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Compensation-Visual-8.jpg\" alt=\"Compensation Visual 8\" /></p>\n<p>Our 2012 study reported that less than half of the consultants we recruited increased in base and bonus when leaving consulting, affirming the common assumption that top consulting firms are the most reputable organizations for generous base salaries and bonuses. Our newest study, however, highlights a shift in compensation and the increased value of consultants to their prospective industry hiring managers.</p>\n<p><em>Our takeaway: Current management consultants are valued higher now more than ever, giving you that extra push to take the leap into an industry role.</em></p>\n<div class=\"the-insight\">\n<p><strong>For more:</strong></p>\n<p>2012 Compensation Report| Offers made to current consultants when transitioning to Industry.</p>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Michael Birshan, a Partner at McKinsey &amp; Company, offered advice for CEOs in a recent LinkedIn article. After studying data on 600 CEOs&#8217; first two years, he found  &#8220;New CEOs should<strong>:</strong> make big, decisive moves quickly; and adopt an outsider’s perspective when they evaluate the business, whether they themselves come from within or outside the company.&#8221; Read <strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/fortune-favours-boldthe-science-ceo-success-michael-birshan\">&#8220;Lessons for new CEOs: Go big, go fast, or go home&#8221;</a></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2. Fortune released its second annual list of the best workplaces for millennials after surveying 88,000 employees.

The Wall Street Journal&#8217;</em>s Nathalie Tadena reported on the lack of diversity in the advertising world. &#8220;In the wake of sexism and racism scandals at major advertising companies in recent years, firms seem to be more aware than ever of the need to address the problem and move past the &#8216;Mad Men&#8217; days,&#8221; Tadena explains. &#8220;Multiple panels at Cannes focused on gender equality and sexist advertising, and companies have renewed their commitments to inclusion programs and better hiring practices.&#8221; Read <strong><a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/madison-avenues-struggles-with-diversity-were-on-full-display-at-cannes-1467021602\">&#8220;Madison Avenue&#8217;s Struggles with Diversity were on Full Display at Cannes</a>.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4. David Stuart and Todd Nordstrom highlighted four important personal qualities leaders should practice more &#8212; listening, nonverbal communication, dealing with change, and saying thank you. The pair&#8217;s Forbes article reminds, &#8220;Hard skills might be what get you the job—but soft skills are what drive friendship, success and happiness at work.&#8221; <strong> </strong>Read<strong> <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidsturt/2016/06/23/4-soft-skills-you-need-to-work-on-and-why/#613aa01069cc\">&#8220;4 Soft Skills You Need to Work On and Why</a>&#8220;</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5.

      "content": "<hr />\n<p>Google opens a new office for Black Girls Code today.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.blackgirlscode.com/\">Black Girls Code</a>, a five-year-old nonprofit devoted to teaching computer and tech skills to girls of color, plans to use its office at Google &#8220;as both a classroom and a base for coordinating its East Coast programs,&#8221; <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3061354/the-future-of-work/black-girls-code-is-moving-into-googles-new-york-offices\">according</a> to Fast Company. &#8220;The nonprofit teaches girls of color to code through a variety of programs ranging from one-day seminars to longer six- or 12-week programs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Black Girls Code&#8217;s founder Kimberly Bryant explained that having the New York office within Google makes it so Google employees &#8220;will have an opportunity to directly interact with young women of color on a regular basis.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Check out more on the coding projects in <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/embed/59b0c56071934?rel=1&amp;src=embed&amp;veggiemode=1\">this video</a> via Fast Company.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/J1mXZMCaRmk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The tech industry has a well-documented challenge when it comes to filling its ranks with women and people of color,&#8221; says Raines International Managing Director Markos Moya, also Raines&#8217; Technology, Media, and Telecom (TMT) and Diversity Practice lead.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our clients in the tech sector certainly focus on this issue, particularly at mid-management and senior levels,&#8221; Moya explains. &#8220;Programs like Black Girls Code and <a href=\"http://www.code2040.org/\">CODE2040</a> are focusing on the next generation to ensure that the technologist talent pool will become richer in its diversity. It is also important that corporations launch their own youth-level diversity programs from within, like Google’s <a href=\"https://csfirst.withgoogle.com/newhome?utm_expid=95153827-14.9xvDAPE4RseIVp6AHBr-kg.1&amp;utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F\">CS First</a> and Dell&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/uscorp1/power-possible-learning\">Youth Learning</a> grassroots initiatives, to help address the tech sphere&#8217;s lack of diversity.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With its Black Girls Code partnership, Google is looking to stay at the front of the pack when pushing forward its community engagement and diversity initiatives.</p>\n<p>Google&#8217;s head of external affairs William Floyd <a href=\"http://www.cnet.com/news/google-gives-black-girls-code-2-8m-space-inside-its-ny-headquarters/\">told</a> CNET, &#8220;We need a tech sector that looks like the society it serves, and groups like Black Girls Code are ensuring that we can cultivate and access talent in communities of color.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Google is currently trying to expand its diversity, after its 2015 diversity statistics found only 2% of staff were African-Americans, according to Fast Company.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Since then, Google has put its money where its mouth is,&#8221; Fast Company says. &#8220;In 2015, it committed to spending <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2015/05/06/technology/google-diversity-plan/\" target=\"_blank\">$150 million</a> on inclusion programs and diversity initiatives both inside and outside the Googleplex. Beyond granting cash to institutions like Black Girls Code, the company is recruiting from a wider pool of colleges around the U.S. in an effort to find talent. It’s also building out programs internally aimed at making its office culture more inclusive to a broad spectrum of people.&#8221;</p>\n<p>To learn more about the organization, visit <a href=\"http://www.blackgirlscode.com/\">www.blackgirlscode.com</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<hr />\n<p>Despite the importance of diversity in the workplace, corporate America continues to struggle over one crucial question: How can companies do a better job hiring more diverse talent?</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our clients, especially Fortune 500 companies, have consistently listed diversity as a metric for success,&#8221; according to Raines International Managing Director Josh Zigman. &#8220;As search partners,&#8221; he continues, &#8220;our goal is to provide balanced slates on 100% of our assignments. Here at Raines International, we have been successful in maintaining this standard by continuing to network and develop relationships with people from a variety of different backgrounds.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Echoing Zigman&#8217;s sentiments, Gravity Media&#8217;s co-founder and CEO Yuriy Boykiv reminded us of the importance of diversity in the corporate world <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/yuriy-boykiv/war-for-talent-how-large-cap-companies-are-fighting-for-diverse-workers.html\">in a recent article for Inc</a>. and laid out a few ways firms can attract diverse employees.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In today&#8217;s world of infinite possibilities, the most agile and profitable organizations know that diversifying their employee base directly correlates to their bottom line,&#8221; Boykiv explains. &#8220;Understanding that our differences herald tremendous opportunities, large-cap companies are actively embracing a multicultural talent base making them more poised to &#8216;win&#8217; as compared to other more homogeneous corporations.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pointing to how diversity helps innovation, happiness at work and relationships with consumers, Boykiv suggests companies support communities at work or recruit from diversity organizations on campus. Companies can take it a step further by offering actual, tangible benefits like paternity leave or mentorship opportunities.</p>\n<p>Companies Boykiv highlighted for their diversity outreach efforts include AT&amp;T, Apple, Marriott, Bank of America and Accenture. We checked out these companies to see how they incorporate and encourage diversity and inclusion.</p>\n<p>For example, Apple&#8217;s diversity motto is &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.apple.com/diversity/\">inclusion inspires innovation</a>.&#8221; Apple broke down its new hires in 2015 to show its global hires were 35% women. In the U.S. last year, new Apple employees were 19% Asian, 13% Hispanic and 11% African American. Apple also partners with dozen of advocacy groups including the Human Rights Campaign and  spent more than $3 billion in 2015 with &#8220;small and diverse suppliers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bank of America <a href=\"http://campus.bankofamerica.com/our-culture/diversity/\">has</a> a Global Diversity and Inclusion Council to promote diversity strategy. The company also donated $300,000 to the OneOrlando Fund following the shooting at the Pulse nightclub and became a Legacy partner for the 2018 Special Olympics USA.</p>\n<p>AT&amp;T&#8217;s Diversity Council <a href=\"http://about.att.com/sites/diversity/our_people\">requires</a> diversity be a part of its business strategy and hosts a number of nonprofit groups dedicated to helping various communities. These groups, according to AT&amp;T, &#8220;provide support, advocacy, education, mentoring and more to groups ranging from culture populations within AT&amp;T and our communities (such as African Americans, Asian Pacific Islanders, Hispanics/Latinos, Filipino Americans, Native Americans and Asian Indians) to military veterans, the disabled, members of the LGBT community, female employees, young and aspiring professionals within our company and those with years of experience.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Around the world, Marriott <a href=\"https://www.marriott.com/diversity/cultural-diversity.mi\">offers</a> training programs, scholarships and mentoring, in addition to cultivating <a href=\"https://www.marriott.com/diversity/partners-in-diversity.mi\">partnerships</a> with dozens of advocacy groups.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, according to Boykiv, one thing remains clear: if we want to win the war for diverse talent, companies must utilize and grow upon these strategies and success of companies like AT&amp;T, Apple, Marriott, Bank of America and Accenture, which are &#8220;being proactive and genuine about creating scalable, inclusive and representative cultures.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Click here to check out more of Boykiv&#8217;s thoughts on the <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/yuriy-boykiv/war-for-talent-how-large-cap-companies-are-fighting-for-diverse-workers.html\">&#8220;War for Talent: How Large-Cap Companies are Fighting for Diverse Workers.&#8221;</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<hr />\n<p>Earlier this week,<em> Adweek</em> <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/inside-story-jjs-revamped-marketing-mission-under-alison-lewis-172013\">profiled</a> Johnson &amp; Johnson&#8217;s first Global Chief Marketing Officer and Raines International placement Alison Lewis about her role in redesigning the conglomerate&#8217;s marketing function and cultivating innovative ways for the company to connect with customers.</p>\n<p>Now in her third year at Johnson &amp; Johnson, Lewis has &#8220;streamlined the marketing efforts of over 100 disparate brands—all of which had various marketing operations functioning simultaneously but not necessarily cohesively—into one centralized force,&#8221; Adweek explains.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On top of that, Lewis says, she has been working to &#8216;globalize brands that in some cases didn&#8217;t have as much scale in certain parts of the world.&#8217; Top priority? The namesake, Johnson&#8217;s, as well as Listerine, Neutrogena and Carefree,&#8221; according to Adweek.</p>\n<p>Lewis points to the importance of an emotional connection with consumers on top of the practical fact that Johnson &amp; Johnson sells products that people need. For example, Adweek noted that Johnson &amp; Johnson proactively contacted consumers to let them know about new products in Neutrogena&#8217;s make-up line. Or how Johnson &amp; Johnson re-directed its efforts and slogan to appeal to the interests and choices of Listerine users.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The thing that I believe sort of sways them to choose your brand over everyone else&#8217;s brand is how they feel,&#8221; Lewis told Ad Week. &#8220;That purpose, that emotion is critical.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In terms of leadership style, Adweek describes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a pragmatic and inspiring leader with a bold vision who tries to empower her people (she manages over 400 employees) to deliver.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Forbes <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/video/4794218157001/\">interviewed</a> Lewis earlier this year about Johnson &amp; Johnson&#8217;s marketing campaigns and expanding the scale and structure of its product marketing. &#8220;We all know that brands that are beloved and admired are actually used by more people and used more often, which would mean we were the fasted growing consumer goods company,&#8221; Lewis says.</p>\n<p>Before joining Johnson &amp; Johnson in December 2013, Lewis served as the Chief Marketing Officer of North America for the Coca-Cola Company before she was recruited by Raines International to her current position.</p>\n<p>To learn more about Alison and her marketing initiatives, read Adweek&#8217;s full <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/inside-story-jjs-revamped-marketing-mission-under-alison-lewis-172013\">profile</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

At Culture Zine, Belle Beth Cooper reviewed the benefits of salary transparency, using Buffer, which released a spreadsheet of all salary employees.  Cooper also noted negative effects including how to navigate staff&#8217;s feelings and working with employees who are on the lower end of the payscale to improve performance.  Read &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.peoplegeeks.com/zine/2016/5/23/pros-and-cons-of-salary-transparency?utm_content=buffer314a0&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\">Pros and Cons of Salary Transparency.&#8221; </a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3. General Electric is changing its performance review practices, the Wall Street Journal&#8217;s Rachel Emma Silverman reported.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Later this month, executives will decide whether to dispense with the practice of rating employees in five categories &#8212; from &#8216;role model&#8217; to &#8216;unsatisfactory&#8217; &#8212; as part of their annual review,&#8221; according to Silverman. &#8220;The company also is considering doing away with strictly scheduled annual raises, instead doling out pay raises and incentives at different times throughout the year, and giving managers other tools to reward and motivate employees, such as time off.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Read<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/ge-re-engineers-performance-reviews-pay-practices-1465358463\"> &#8220;GE Re-Engineers Performance Reviews, Pay Practices&#8221;</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4. Yazamo co-founder Jeremy Ellens highlighted keys to success for entrepreneurs in a recent article.

      "content": "<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>This month, Raines International will be taking a look at an increasingly popular path for consultants looking to enter industry: transitioning from consulting to Private equity.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>We spoke with several executives who transitioned from their consulting firms to the Private equity world, whether joining an Operations team or a Portfolio company, and identified several things consultants should consider when looking to make the move. Read on to see what your options are, how private equity is different from consulting, and what to expect at your new firm.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>From Consulting to Private Equity</strong></p>\n<p>There are two primary paths for consultants into the Private equity industry: the operations team and a portfolio company (while a small portion of consultants end up working in an Investment Team, firms primarily target individuals with investment banking or Private equity backgrounds for these roles).</p>\n<p>Many consultants choose to join an Operations Team at the Private equity level because it allows them to leverage their consulting toolkit to assess and drive operational improvement opportunities within a firm’s portfolio. When comparing consulting to Private equity, Brian Slobodow, an Operating Executive at Golden Gate Capital and A.T. Kearney Alum, explains that Private equity Operations Teams are “like consulting on steroids, and you parachute in and out of different companies.”</p>\n<p>In contrast with those hired to Operations Teams, many consultants are hired as executive members of a Portfolio Company.  In this role, individuals are fully embedded in the portfolio companies. As Brian explains, “I get my paycheck directly from the Portfolio Companies themselves – there is some &#8216;nice-to-have&#8217; additional perks from my affiliation with Golden Gate Capital after that. When asked what I do today, the first thing I tell people is that I am the Chief Operations Officer of a window company.”</p>\n<p>Whether you choose to join a Portfolio Company or Operations Team, here are what a few Private equity execs had to say on what to expect when transitioning from consulting to Private Equity:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><u>Increased and more direct impact and influence</u></p>\n<p>According to Adam Fless, a Director in KKR&#8217;s Operations Group KKR Capstone and  A.T. Kearney Alum, “the greatest positive of Private equity is seeing and sharing in the success you have created.” Adam describes Private equity execs as “shareholders” in the firm’s portfolio companies, which gives both him and colleagues “an incentive to make these companies successful financially.”</p>\n<p>“There is an &#8216;eat your own cooking&#8217; element to the job,” he explains, “because it demands intellectual honesty in the work you do. Making it look like you delivered value isn’t going to help anybody, including yourself.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Like Adam, Jeff Kimbell, a former Operating Executive at Silver Lake Partners and current Partner at McKinsey &amp; Company, highlights the difference between serving &#8220;clients&#8221; at consulting firms and serving &#8220;companies&#8221; at a Private equity firm. This differing terminology signals an even larger difference in what Private equity firms do and how they do it. “While many management consulting firms will deny it,” he explains, “at the end of the day their product is a recommendation that comes in the form of a PowerPoint presentation. And I’ve done that before. In what I do now, I barely ever use PowerPoint presentations. I’ll get a 6-month project for a company and I have a revenue target – that’s my product.”</p>\n<p>Adam and Jeff&#8217;s experiences demonstrate how members of Private equity firms are afforded more opportunities to deliver value, taking on the role of shareholders who make direct impacts and influence in the company&#8217;s and their firm&#8217;s initiatives.</p>\n<p><u>Increased accountability</u></p>\n<p>While Private equity execs often have increased impact on the companies they work with, their shareholder status extends to the overall survival of their firm. Brian explains:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“</strong>In consulting, if you fail, the firm as a whole will likely still survive. Even if a project goes disastrously wrong with a client, the firm as a whole will go on its way with other client engagements (unless you have something along the lines of a large lawsuit, and that’s extremely rare).&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>This, however, is not the case at a Private equity firm, he explains:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;A private equity firm is a combination of the assets on which you are working, and if you fail, there’s a chance the firm as a whole could fail as well. No matter how rosy a situation is painted for consultants re: private equity, there’s no getting around the fact that you’re generally in very stressful situations – more stressful than what you dealt with in consulting.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>While consultants can look forward to stepping into role where they will have more impact and influence within their projects, many simultaneously experience the stresses that come with the responsibilities of their roles. Therefore, consultants should be aware of the pros and cons of this double-edged sword.</p>\n<p><u>Diversity of experiences, for better or for worse</u></p>\n<p>When discussing the highlights of their Private equity experiences, many execs point to the high degree of variety in initiatives they drove. David Snider, COO/CFO of Compass and a former Associate at Bain Capital, describes how he <strong>“</strong>really enjoyed [his] experiences in the sense that [he] worked on four deals, which were all very different types of transactions with very bright people.” Like David, Jeff highlights the ability to work with a <strong>“</strong>variety of companies and business situations–a gun manufacturer, a paper producer, a software company, etc. in situations from bankruptcy to ones with high growth targets” as a crucial positive feature of his transition from consulting.</p>\n<p>Brian reminds us, however, that “Private equity is not all high-growth situations, IPOs, and opening up new markets.” Often times, timing will greatly influence whether your expectations become reality. When joining his firm, Brian relayed to us the difficulties of entering the industry in 2007, during the brink of the financial meltdown. While he, like many, look forward to the fruits of working with a company experiencing high-growth, his experience was altered by the fact that &#8220;the Private equity industry in general was bursting at the seams.&#8221; Despite working during an uncertain time focusing on cost-cutting, he explains how he &#8220;did the right thing and stayed on, but it took four full years&#8230;.to turn it around before [he] was given that second opportunity” for projects involving IPOs, new markets, and high-growth situations. Ultimately, you will sometimes have to &#8220;pay it forward&#8221; in your first role to really get a chance at the kind of opportunities that excite consultants about the Private equity industry.</p>\n<p><u>Varying Income</u></p>\n<p>There is a general consensus that with a move from consulting to Private Equity comes a guaranteed a significant pay raise. Brian, however, informs us that this is not always that case:</p>\n<blockquote><p> “I have observed that the economics can be very hot and cold. It&#8217;s generally equity-based compensation, so if you end up in the right situation, the returns can be impressive. If you end up in the wrong situation, your equity can be worth nothing. At times, it can be a challenging position, and it can make sense for people in roles like mine to take on additional professional opportunities to up their income.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>As Brian confirms, it is important to taper your expectations on the type of income you will earn from the get-go. Like the types of initiatives you will push forward with your companies, compensation is ultimately determined by time and place.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whether looking to join an Operations Group or Portfolio Company, there are several key differentiating factors consultants should consider when looking to move to a Private Equity Firm. Our hope is that, with these tips, you can come step in the P.E. world with the right mindset about what you’re going to do and how to navigate the new working environment.</p>\n",

This June 3 post is our seventh installment of our weekly roundup of the must read articles on business, consulting, recruiting and jobs that we at Raines Perspectives are reading. </em></p>\n<p>1. The Wall Street Journal&#8217;s Newley Purnell reports that Southeast Asia may be a good home for startups.  “Between Southeast Asia and India there are about two billion people,” Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin said at the Converge conference in Hong Kong. “It’s arguably the fastest-growing internet market in the world.”</p>\n<p>Why is Southeast Asia a hot spot? &#8220;U.S. investors eyeing Asia once thought only of China or India, but are now increasingly turning to Southeast Asia, [Golden Gate Ventures&#8217;s Vinnie] Lauria said,&#8221; the Journal reported. &#8220;That is mostly due to its collective population of about 600 million people, many of whom are under the age of 40 and entering the internet economy for the first time via low-cost smartphones.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Read &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/southeast-asia-startup-scene-is-sunny-investors-say-1464951113\">Southeast Asia Startup Scene is Sunny, Investors Say&#8221;</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2. How big should sales teams be? Harvard Business Review examined what it called a Goldilocks quandary of sales teams either being bloated or too thin, making them ineffective. &#8220;By looking at detailed sales data from 40 companies in technology-related industries, we have identified guidelines for the optimal amount and type of sales support and management,&#8221; Harvard Business Review reported. &#8220;This includes all non-quota-carrying roles in the organization: customer-facing support, sales operations and administration, and sales management.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Learn what size they recommend for your best return on investment. Read: &#8220;<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/05/in-the-best-sales-teams-about-half-of-the-people-are-in-support-roles?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=harvardbiz\">In the Best Sales Teams, About Half of the People are in Support Roles.&#8221; </a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3. YourStory.com highlighted Aakash Borse, Vishal Kulkarni and Jalay Pandya&#8217;s start-up consulting firm, Faber Infinite, and how they grew across India, Africa and Middle East.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While countries are focusing on competitiveness, with campaigns like Make in India in the country, and Vision 2030 in Kenya – there is a severe need for coaching, catalyst and change agents to support the growing enterprises, which are the engine for growth for any country,&#8221; YourStory reported. Read <a href=\"http://yourstory.com/2016/06/faber-infinite/\">&#8220;How this trio built a consulting firm with a presence in six countries, from Ahmedabad.&#8221;</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4. The Boston Globe profiled Boston Consulting Group principal Amy Hsuan and explained what her role entails. &#8220;Consultants here, she said, have a lot of ownership over what projects they work on and whether they travel much or not at all,&#8221; the Globe reported. &#8220;As for the hours, Hsuan said it totally depends what kind of project you’re working on. For the past few weeks, Hsuan said she’s maintained a fairly typical 9-5 schedule.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Read <a href=\"https://www.boston.com/jobs/jobs-news/2016/05/27/boston-consulting-group-former-journalist\">&#8220;What it takes to be a consultant at Boston Consulting Group, one of the top places to work in the U.S.&#8221;</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

I acquired a great foundation in problem-solving, and I saw how a wide variety of industries operate: from airlines, to consumer goods, to media and telecommunications. In my native Spain, I was truly privileged to get this kind of training.</p>\n<p><em>After business school you returned to BCG. What was your experience like in BCG’s New York office after spending your first four years with the firm in Madrid?</em></p>\n<p>It was an incredible experience. BCG is truly a global firm and you find incredibly smart and humble individuals in every office, so from that perspective, there was no change. I was very excited at the opportunity of having such a high level of responsibility in a new environment.</p>\n<p><em>What were you looking to get out of your consulting experience the second time around?</em></p>\n<p>After my time at BCG Madrid, I had nailed down the nuts and bolts of consulting, especially what we can call &#8220;hard skills&#8221;: problem-solving, analysis, writing presentations, etc. This second time around, I wanted to focus more on the &#8220;soft side&#8221;, in particular, I wanted to manage teams and develop my leadership skills. I became a Project Leader and for the first time I was responsible for a team, and overall, for the quality of our work. I no longer had everything under control, and I had to learn how to drive and influence my team members. It was exactly the experience I wanted to get.</p>\n<p><em>Within consulting, how did you make your way into the Technology, Media &amp; Entertainment Practice?</em></p>\n<p>BCG had given me the opportunity to work on almost every industry. At first, I loved the diversity and diving into something new every few months. Over time, I developed a preference. Still in Spain, I had the chance to work on a major transformation plan for the Spanish National Television and Radio. And I got the media bug. During my MBA, I interned at MTV in Strategy and Operations, and worked on an acquisition project. By the time I got back to BCG, I still thought consulting was the ideal platform to develop my skills, but I knew eventually I wanted to apply them to the industry I liked the most. And that was Media &amp; Entertainment. In particular, I found the digital transformation of media companies to be an extremely interesting topic: high uncertainty, great disruption, emergence of new competitors, need for business model innovation. All in all, a very tough environment! That&#8217;s exactly what I was looking for.</p>\n<p><em>At what point did you decide to pursue opportunities outside the firm?</em></p>\n<p>I was a second year Project Leader and I had already acquired a great deal of management and leadership experience. At the same time, I was approaching the point in the consulting trajectory where you need to make a decision: Do you want to be a partner or not? If you do, it&#8217;s all about building your platform for promotion and senior support system. I evaluated what I wanted to do and clearly saw two things: first, I wanted to work at the intersection of media and technology. Second, I wanted to have both a strategy and an execution role. I did not want to be an adviser any more.</p>\n<p><em>How did the opportunity at AOL come about?</em></p>\n<p>My former boss at MTV recommended me for the AOL job. I met the team, and I saw tremendous fit and opportunity. The company had some great assets and a good cash position. At the same time, it needed dramatic transformation. It wasn&#8217;t particularly large from an employee standpoint. My role was to build and lead a strategy and operations team working on the AOL turnaround, very close to the top leaders. I thought it was an incredible opportunity. Also, I love underdogs, and I felt AOL was an underdog at the time.</p>\n<p><em>You joined AOL after nearly eight years with BCG. What was the transition like from management consulting to industry given your extensive consulting background? Were there any surprises or challenges?</em></p>\n<p>When you have been at BCG your entire professional career, you always have some fear of the &#8220;real world.&#8221; But overall I would say BCG really prepared me well. I was a very quick learner, focused on impact, and able to prioritize &#8211; all of this can directly be traced to consulting.</p>\n<p><em>You have worked in many different work environments during your post-consulting career, with 3.5 years under the leadership of Tim Armstrong at AOL and Huffington Post, nearly a year in a high-risk high-reward start-up environment at Fusion, and in the post-merger environment of DigitasLBi. Having worked under a variety of CEOs, what do you find most compelling in a leader?</em></p>\n<p>This is an incredibly hard question. I have been lucky to work with incredible leaders and learn from them. If I had to sum up what makes a great CEO in my opinion, it is two things.</p>\n<p><em>How did you come to know what the best leadership style is for you?</em></p>\n<p>I have a few principles that I believe in, that I have tested and I think work. First, I believe in inspiring by setting up a clear, exciting vision upfront. Second, I believe in frequent communication. I spend time with my teams and very openly talk about what leadership style they prefer, our goals and expectations. Lastly, every leader must develop their team and make it better. So I deliberately spend time thinking about how to accomplish that.</p>\n<p><em>As you know, there has been a lot of discussion recently on the composition of the advertising workforce. How do you see DigitasLBi highlighting diversity as a priority and how do you address these issues within your own role?</em></p>\n<p>The face of our industry does not reflect the consumer marketplace we serve. And that fundamentally means we are not doing our best. This has been and is a huge priority for DigitasLBi and, recognizing the road behind and the distance ahead, we have made tangible commitments to address it. For example, we have gender parity goals for senior leadership. We make sure there are diversity candidates in every recruiting process. We have mentoring programs for diversity groups. We have investments and key alliances with partners to foster the diversity agenda. And a commitment from our leadership to have individual performance metrics tethered to the agency&#8217;s diversity goals.</p>\n<p><em>On the topic of the advertising industry, digital and mobile are taking a sizable share of companies’ advertising budgets. How is your company embracing the shift to digital and how are you preparing for that in your own role?</em></p>\n<p>Our heritage as an agency is primarily digital, so the budget shift plays in our favor. I would say that rather than the channel issue, what we see in consumers is a fundamental behavior change in what relates to interacting with brands, and in particular advertising. Ads are not enough to win consumers: nine out of ten people skip them and ad blocking is rising and will become prevalent. Marketers need to create meaningful narratives and targeted experiences that entertain or provide tangible value to their audiences. As an agency, that&#8217;s where we are going. Take the best storytelling, data, and technology and blend it into something (not an ad) that people want to talk about.</p>\n<p><em>Looking back on your experiences over the five years since you left the Boston Consulting Group, how has your consulting experience shaped your career since leaving the firm? Could you have arrived to the same point without it?</em></p>\n<p>My BCG experience has definitely shaped my career. The way I approach problems and a large subset of my &#8216;toolkit&#8217; were acquired during my time at the firm. So it will always be part of who I am.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<div class=\"profile-intro\">Position: Senior Director, Corporate Strategy</div>\n<div class=\"profile-intro\"></div>\n<p>Current Firm: Sailthru</p>\n<p><em>You spent your pre-MBA career at Inductis Consulting, leaving after almost three years to earn your MBA at The University of Chicago. What prompted you to pursue your MBA at that point, rather than later?</em></p>\n<p>I studied math and econ in college and was looking for broad exposure to business issues. I joined a boutique consulting firm, which was a great learning experience. I was thrown right in the deep end. But it was a smaller shop, which means a narrower range of functional topics and clients. From there, my decision to go back to business school came from a place of wanting to keep learning, to build a broader network, and to take a step back and think more holistically about my career and what I wanted to do.</p>\n<p><em>While you mention that you were industry and function-agnostic when entering your MBA program at the University of Chicago, you made the decision to return to management consulting after business school, this time at Boston Consulting Group. How did that happen?</em></p>\n<p>Heading to UChicago, one thing I was certain of was that I was not going to look for consulting internships; I wanted to use my MBA summer to try new things. I split that summer between Time Inc. and American Apparel – very different places, but each a great opportunity to try something different.</p>\n<p>One of my projects that summer had me managing a team of 6 undergraduate interns on a very consultant-y type of project. That was by far the most rewarding part of my summer, so when I came back to campus after the summer, having spent some time thinking about what I enjoy and what I was looking for next, consulting again seemed like a pretty natural fit. Then when I got back to Chicago in the fall I recruited for consulting, really hit it off with the people I met from BCG, and landed in their New York office.</p>\n<p><em>When you headed back into consulting, you already had about three years of experience under your belt. How was your experience with Boston Consulting Group different from your experience at Inductis? What were you looking to get out of your consulting experience this time around?</em></p>\n<p>There are two main differences between a place like Inductis and a place like BCG. One is the broader functional set of problems that I was exposed to at BCG. Both from an industry and functional standpoint, smaller firms, while offering great experiences, can be a bit limiting if what you are looking for is variety. BCG, on the other hand, offered me the full gamut, and I took advantage of that. Second, I think in general the conversations were more elevated; we were working on more difficult problems, just by virtue of all the great CEO, Board, and senior leadership relationships that BCG came in with.</p>\n<p><em>Going back into consulting, did you ever anticipate staying at BCG for nearly seven years?</em></p>\n<p>Most people who go into consulting don’t anticipate staying more than two or three years. For my part, I was definitely working on a series of one-year plans, taking time at the beginning of each year to step back, reflecting on what I had done over the last year, and asking myself if I saw enough opportunities to continue to develop and grow over the next year, or two, or three. I think that if you enjoy the work and you enjoy the team dynamics and the culture, that all can lead you to stay on much longer. You are continually getting opportunities to learn and to take on new challenges that you don’t find anywhere else.</p>\n<p><em>What drove your decision to leave the firm despite those continual new learning opportunities and challenges?</em></p>\n<p>I had some great experiences during my time in the Principal role, but I was also aware that my entire career to that point had been in consulting, and I was finding myself drawn to more hands-on operating roles. That all led me pretty convincingly to start taking a more serious look at other opportunities.</p>\n<p><em>Having come to the conclusion between year six and year seven, how did you decide what particular opportunities, companies and industries you wanted to pursue?</em></p>\n<p>My last few years at BCG were concentrated in CPG, technology, and media. I looked at opportunities in all those fields, but I also had some good friends at venture-funded technology companies, and the more I spoke with them, the more interested I became. BCG has a really strong alumni network in New York tech, which became an incredibly valuable resource for me during my search.</p>\n<p><em>Once you made that decision, how did the opportunity at Sailthru come about?</em></p>\n<p>They actually found me: a recruiter from the company reached out, and it was one of those right-place/right-time things. I had a number of conversations with them over the span of a couple months, met the team and sensed a really strong fit: a fascinating company with a high-performing team in a dynamic space, with tons of space for someone like me to come in and have an impact.</p>\n<p><em>What was the transition like moving from management consulting to a start-up environment after nearly ten years of consulting experience? Were they any surprises or challenges?</em></p>\n<p>The biggest change for me, which is probably true for anyone transitioning from a large consulting firm to an early-stage company, was not having a team of five or six consultants to manage. Right now, my team is quite lean, and that’s the way it’s going to be for the foreseeable future. That means that I am spending a lot more time in Excel these days. It also puts heightened importance on developing the team around me, and prioritizing projects in order to get the most out of limited resources.</p>\n<p><em>Once you transitioned to Sailthru, you were the first consultant on the ground. What was that like? Did you have a plan going in to hit the ground running and to make the most out of time there from day one?</em></p>\n<p>Strategy functions aren’t too common for companies at this stage, so just the existence of the role was a very positive signal to me about their openness to someone with the consulting skillset coming and contributing. I came in with a first-100-day plan that included learning about the company, the people, the culture and the competitive space, then uncovering a few quick wins and some longer-term initiatives to take on. Not the most specific, but if I had gone with a more defined week-by-week plan I don’t think it would have stuck – it’s hard to know exactly where to focus until you’ve spent some time listening and learning, and the time element is different when you’re joining a new company vs. when you’re starting a new consulting engagement.</p>\n<p><em>Now a year in, are you currently working to build out your strategy team?</em></p>\n<p>My philosophy is that strategy can become a talent pool for the organization. My plan is to bring people in, get them to learn the business, to help them figure out what they want to do, and to then find a role for them elsewhere in the company at the right time.</p>\n<p><em>After joining a company while in its early stages, what is your company today compared to what it was when you joined last June?</em></p>\n<p>It’s been quite a year – we launched a new product (an on-site complement to our email platform) and completed our first acquisition, which added mobile messaging to the product suite. So there’s a lot of excitement around not just having a great vision around retention marketing, but really executing on it and starting to see it play out in the market. Things move really quickly at a place like Sailthru, which was what drew me to the space in the first place. It’s exciting knowing that you can go to work every day and have the opportunity to make a huge impact in so many ways.</p>\n<p><em>As the head of the strategy function of one of the fastest-growing companies in North America, where do you see the company going and how are you preparing for that within your role?</em></p>\n<p>As quickly as we’ve been growing, there’s plenty of runway ahead of us – new channels, verticals, geographies. At the same time, we are playing in a highly competitive market, and so the imperative for us is to demonstrate what makes us different, which we accomplish by making our customers successful. If I can help us keep a close eye on the market, execute effectively and stay focused on what really matters, then I’m putting the company in a position to succeed.</p>\n<p><em>Looking back at your time in consulting, do you think you could have gotten to where you are now without those experiences? In general, what do you find has made up your recipe for success?</em></p>\n<p>I think the better question is “How do I define success for myself? What is it that I want to do? What is it that makes me happy?” I stayed at BCG as long as I did because I really enjoyed the work I was doing and the people I got to work with. For other people, that calculation might be different. Everyone has their own recipe for success.</p>\n",

      "content": "<hr />\n<p>Having outlined the various pros and cons of Partnership (&#8220;Making Partner: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly&#8221;) and how to get there (&#8220;Sink or Swim? Assessing Your Chances at Making Partner&#8221;) our last installment in the Raines International Partner Series identifies the reasons why consultants leave the Partner Path and offers advice for those looking to make their next move.</p>\n<p>According to Gil Krakowsky, Vice President, Global Strategy &amp; Business Development, The Gap, Inc. and A.T. Kearney Alum, &#8220;the consulting career development track is geared to focus on Partnership as a prize. It is not geared to having you sit back and look across your professional and personal life and decide what is right for you at that particular moment in your career.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>But what comes next?</strong></p>\n<p>When thinking about next steps or leaving, Partners find themselves asking a different yet eerily familiar question to the one asked when initially joining the firm:</p>\n<p>&#8220;I know I wanted to make Partner, but do I want to <em>stay</em> Partner?&#8221;</p>\n<p>After eight years in consulting, former McKinsey &amp; Company Partner Usman Rabbani, &#8220;had written a plan to stay at McKinsey for the rest of [his] career&#8221; despite his original plan to remain at the company for only two years.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While I was open to new opportunities, I felt that there were very few things that could be as compelling as what I had as a Partner&#8221; at McKinsey, Usman, now Director and Technology Operating Lead at KKR Capstone, explains.</p>\n<p>Having reached the near top of the management consulting food chain, Partners are left with two options: Either remain in the role for the rest of their days or transition into the corporate world.</p>\n<p>Several former Partners from top-tier management consulting firms shared with the Raines team their advice for Partners who are thinking about transitioning out of management consulting and how to identify and secure the best next opportunity.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>Making the Decision to Leave</strong></p>\n<p>There are many reasons successful consultants and Partners may choose to pursue opportunities outside of management consulting. For Alison Levy, Group Vice President at Ross Stores, Inc. and former Kurt Salmon Partner, the increasing difficulties of maintaining a proper work-life balance drove her decision to leave the firm:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I started to consider other opportunities at a point where my family situation changed. Consulting is really fun and dynamic, but I have never seen it in any context across any firm where it isn’t also extremely intense. The more senior you get, the more intense it becomes. You don’t really give up responsibilities – you just take on additional ones and you take them more seriously because you are a shareholder in the firm and you are responsible for driving your own revenue.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As a Partner, there were so many more competing demands on my time right when I had my first child. I realized that perhaps I would look back on this point in my life and not feel good about how I was prioritizing my commitments.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Echoing Alison&#8217;s concerns, Delaney Steele, Senior Vice President, Strategy &amp; Marketing for Ross Stores, Inc. and Boston Consulting Group Alum elaborates on the ways her personal skill-set ultimately were not a perfect match for the role:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I did not like the commercial side [of being Partner]. Frankly, I wasn’t as good at the commercial side as I had expected I would be. Some people really like that side, too. You just have to realize that’s the single biggest difference in the role between Principal and Partner. The pressure is absolutely enormous to bring in revenue and build-out clients. Unless you’re someone who really likes to be in what is basically a sales-oriented role, it may not be a role that you like. I did not like it as much as I thought I would, because I really like content and problem-solving, but I did not like having to sell work.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>While Alison and Delaney&#8217;s experiences highlight some of the cons of the Partner role, other&#8217;s may choose to leave the partner track behind in order to embark down a different path towards an industry role.</p>\n<p>Usman, like many other partners, had not set his sights on the Partner role since Day 1. Once finding himself in the position, however, he &#8220;never found a mix of things that was as compelling as what McKinsey had to offer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He was open to new opportunities because he wanted to be challenged again and when the right opportunity came along at KKR, Usman was ready to transition. Usman explains:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I felt that the KKR opportunity had everything that I valued at McKinsey, and then much more. The people, the professional development, the level of responsibility, the autonomy, and the sense of ownership are all unbelievable at KKR. The quality of future opportunities is probably higher here than at McKinsey.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Even if you aren&#8217;t looking for a different opportunity, it still is good to keep an eye out just in case.</em></p>\n<p>A former Partner at the Boston Consulting Group and currently Executive Vice President of Strategy &amp; Revenue Management at US Foods, Dave Rickard shared with us the harsh, but true realities of staying on the Partner path for too long.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When I was on the fence about whether I should stay longer,&#8221; Dave remembers, &#8220;another BCG alumnus was very blunt with me. He said, &#8216;Look, you’ve been a consultant for 16 years. No one has any doubt about your skill set in that vein. Every incremental year you spend in consulting, you’re just getting older and less employable.'&#8221;</p>\n<p>It &#8220;is pretty harsh,&#8221; says Dave, &#8220;but probably has a lot of truth in it. I would encourage folks to take that leap sooner rather than later.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>Our Takeaway</strong></p>\n<p>When deciding whether or not to take that &#8216;leap&#8217; into the unknown, Gil asserts that you can only make the best decision after cultivating &#8220;your own definition of success.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When asked what advice he would have for a Partner at a top firm who is thinking about leaving and wondering how to identify and secure the best next opportunity, Gil admits his own fears when contemplating leaving the Partner path and how he came to the right decision:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I was thinking about taking this job [outside A.T. Kearney], and I was a bit hesitant because&#8230; I had just become a Partner and I was going to make all this money, I was going to fly around the world, I was going to get all these clients… I just started building this list of all of the things I had been told. At some point I had to sit down and really define what success meant for me. I think it’s really about defining what’s going to make you happy, and separating yourself from all of the things you are being told about how to define your happiness.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So while there are many reasons Partners choose to leave or stay, at the end of the day it is most important for Partners to make a decision that he/she can stick to and run with.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>According to Gil Krakowsky, Vice President, Global Strategy &amp; Business Development, The Gap, Inc. and A.T. Kearney Alum, &#8220;the consulting career development track is geared to focus on Partnership as a prize. It is not geared to having you sit back and look across your professional and personal life and decide what is right for you at that particular moment in your career.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>Having outlined the various pros and cons of Partnership (&#8220;Making Partner: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly&#8221;) our next installment in the Partner Series looks at the next crucial step in the path to Partner: assessing your chances of making Partner in light of your professional experiences, corporate contributions, and success rate at your firm.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Let&#8217;s set the scene. You are a fourth-year Principal at a top-tier management consulting firm. You have received &#8216;Very Strong&#8217; and &#8216;Distinctive&#8217; ratings throughout your consulting career. You have spoken with your colleagues, mulled over the pros and cons, and asked the tough questions. One thing is now abundantly clear: You want to make Partner.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em><strong>So, now what?</strong></em></p>\n<p>Despite your achievements and high performance, you might not necessarily make or be a good fit for Partner.</p>\n<p>&#8220;People who have been successful their entire careers don’t realize that does not automatically transfer into making Partner,&#8221; Delaney Steele, Senior Vice President, Strategy &amp; Marketing for Ross Stores, Inc. and Boston Consulting Group Alum explains.</p>\n<p>After speaking with several executives who successfully made it to the Partner-level, the Raines team identified four key factors that could determine whether you can realistically and successfully pursue Partnership at your firm:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><b>An Established Internal Network</b></p>\n<p>Dave Rickard, Executive Vice President, Strategy and Revenue Management for US Foods and former Partner at The Boston Consulting Group, points out to Raines International that &#8220;if you encounter people who have moved from sector to sector, client to client, topic to topic…it’s probably a good indication that they aren’t getting enough repeat buyers from the Partner level, which means they aren’t at the top of someone’s queue, which makes it harder for them to get to Partner in the long term.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Like Dave, Gil emphasizes the importance of a supportive internal network. &#8220;At the end of the day, becoming a Partner is not a promotion,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;Becoming a Partner is an election. And that’s true everywhere. There needs to be a core group of Partners who are saying, visibly, audibly, to other Partners, that they believe you should be their peer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Like Dave and Gil, Delaney also speaks to the importance of networking and relationship-building before moving forward.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;So much of making Partner isn’t just about how capable you are, it’s about being established in commercial relationships with a strong set of Partners who are vouching for you,&#8221; she states. &#8220;Unless you have an influential and successful Senior Partner with a big book of business specifically saying, &#8216;I will take you through to the end and support you even after you make Partner,&#8217; then I think you are kidding yourself. If you are not getting that absolutely explicit input, not just from the office head but literally from the person who is going to write your sponsorship recommendation and support you as you go through, it’s either not going to happen or even if it does you will flounder as a Junior Partner. You really need that Senior Partner coverage to be successful.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>Timing</strong></p>\n<p>Bain &amp; Company Alum and Digital Acceleration Officer of Groupe SEB Nicolai Gerard decided not to pursue the Partner Path despite a successful track-record at the Principal-level.</p>\n<p>One of the main reasons was the time factor. &#8220;When I was a Principal at Bain,&#8221; Nicolai told Raines, &#8220;the pipeline to Partner was getting a little bit stuffed and it was going to take me longer than expected. I certainly got a little bit demotivated and demoralized by the idea of having to wait a little longer to be a Partner.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Similarly, Delaney remembers the downturn hampered her ability to make Partner on the timetable she expected.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Things outside of your control, like there are too many people who have been promoted recently in your practice, or there are too many Junior Partners,&#8221; Delaney told us, &#8220;can keep you from making Partner&#8221; on the track you expected.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, it doesn&#8217;t matter if you have all of the credentials and building blocks because timing can throw you off track. &#8220;I was supposed to make Partner during the downturn, and that was out of my control,&#8221; Delaney reminds.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>A Specific Partner Skillset</strong></p>\n<p>If you want to make Partner, you should take a step back and reflect on how to achieve the position and what the role will mean for you.</p>\n<p>According to Delaney,  &#8220;In reality, you can be a top 10% performer your entire consulting career and still not make Partner.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Therefore it is crucial for a consultant with Partner aspirations to assess their own work in light of the potential new responsibilities and challenges that come with the role.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Are you successful by a margin, or are you just barely clearing the bars? The bars only get more and more difficult to clear, so if you are just barely making it through each successive promotion, it’s not going to be fun for you,&#8221; Dave tells Raines.</p>\n<p>It is also important to remember the different expectations of Consultants at the Partner-level that could potentially clash with your own set of skills, experiences, and hopes for the role:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Pressure for Sales: </strong>&#8220;The pressure is absolutely enormous to bring in revenue and build-out clients. Unless you’re someone who really likes to be in what is basically a sales-oriented role, it may not be a role that you like. I did not like it as much as I thought I would, because I really like content and problem-solving, but I did not like having to sell work.&#8221; &#8212; Delaney Steele, Senior Vice President, Strategy &amp; Marketing for Ross Stores, Inc.; Boston Consulting Group Alum.</p>\n<p><strong>Need to Actively Take Charge of Decisions: </strong>&#8220;In terms of soft skills, it is important to understand that there are always going to be road blocks. The folks who take a step back and say, &#8216;I don’t know what to do, but we have three options, and I think we should do option A, and here’s why&#8217; have a more empowered perspective than people who throw up their hands and say &#8216;I don’t know what to do, I need help.&#8217; You may not always be right, but taking the forward steps and saying &#8216;this is what I think we should do and here is why&#8217; gives you a lot more power over your career.&#8221; &#8212;<a href=\"http://consultanttrack.com/profiles/david/\">Dave Rickard</a>, Executive Vice President, Strategy and Revenue Management for US Foods</p>\n<p><strong>Confidence: </strong>&#8220;I was always very direct with A.T. Kearney, and basically said, &#8216;Look, here is when I expect to make Partner. There is no up-or-out model here, but I see it as an up-or-out. If you don’t want me as a Partner on the basis of the performance I’ve laid out, then let’s just agree that you don’t want me as a Partner and I’ll go do something else.&#8217; I had that conversation a year-and-a-half out with a number of different people, and it wasn’t menacing or threatening. It was just, &#8216;Let’s be honest, here’s the performance, I believe it is Partner-level work. Either I’m totally delusional and you need to bring me back down to earth; or it is Partner-level work but you’re unwilling to make me a Partner for some other reason; or it is Partner-level work and at that point let’s just call it what it is.&#8217; Maybe others don’t have that conversation. It is also possible they aren’t in the position of strength to have that conversation.&#8221; &#8212; <a href=\"http://consultanttrack.com/profiles/gil/\">Gil Krakowsky</a>, Vice President, Global Strategy &amp; Business Development, The Gap, Inc.; A.T. Kearney Alum</p></blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>The final verdict? <strong>Make your decision sooner rather than later</strong></p>\n<p>Gil summarizes the most important factors in whether to pursue partner: do you want it and if so, what do you need to do?</p>\n<p>&#8220;My strong recommendation for any Principal would be that very early in your Principal career, you should conduct that assessment and decide where you want to be in the near future, and what makes sense for you both professionally and personally,&#8221; Gil says. &#8221; If you conduct that assessment and you want to be a Partner, then the difference of that 18 months in the spectrum of your career is irrelevant.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you ultimately see that your future is outside of consulting, in my experience the industry perceives zero difference between a first-year Principal and a third-year Principal,&#8221; Gil has found. &#8220;If you want to go to industry, you might as well go as soon as you’ve made Principal. If you want to make Partner, the twelve-month bump sounds frustrating, but if ultimately you’re going to be a Partner for ten or twenty years, it doesn’t seem like it should matter all that much.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

There was a lot of discussion on Twitter this week about C-suite positions: specifically, whether the CMO was replacing the CIO.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gigaom.com/2015/02/09/the-cmo-is-not-replacing-the-cio-and-heres-why/\">Tech site GigaOm wrote </a>last year that &#8220;The CMO is not replaced the CIO and here&#8217;s why. &#8220;The argument is that &#8220;the transformational CIO, unlike the traditional CIO, is in high-demand&#8221; because of the IT responsibility.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Enterprise Irregulars <a href=\"https://www.enterpriseirregulars.com/106383/restructuring-c-suite-digital-business-future-cmo-cco-cio-cdo/ s\">discussed </a>the merging of CMO and CCO positions, which it suggested helps &#8220;oversee engagement across the single continuum of digital.&#8221; suggested that the CIO and CDO roles might combine moving forward because their work overlaps.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2. Martin Zwilling <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/martinzwilling/2016/04/21/7-leadership-tips-when-the-business-is-struggling/?utm_campaign=Forbes&amp;utm_source=TWITTER&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_channel=Entrepreneurs&amp;linkId=23745907#15b031f46037\">provides </a>&#8220;7 Leadership Tips when the Business is Struggling&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tips include managing staff anxiety, listening to the team, work directly with staff, and &#8220;create an environment that encourages and rewards participation and progress, with no penalties for missteps.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3. At Fortune, Russ Becker, President of the Forum Corporation, <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/04/10/great-leader/?xid=soc_socialflow_twitter_FORTUNE\">identifies </a>the most important qualities for leaders. writing:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span class=\"s2\">Effective leadership</span><span class=\"s1\"> requires a combination of several different qualities. However, if I had to name just one that really sets the foundation, I would say that strength-based management is key. </span><span class=\"s1\">Strength-based management is when a company’s leadership embraces the idea of aligning individuals’ roles within the company with the strengths and passions of those employees</span><span class=\"s2\">.&#8221; </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"s2\">The best way to do that is to connect with staff on a variety of levels, Becker suggested.</span></p>\n<p>4. Adobe got rid of the traditional performance reviews and replaced them with more frequent, personalized discussions about progress, development and goals. <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/06/16/adobe-employee-retention/?xid=soc_socialflow_twitter_FORTUNE\">According </a>to Anne Fisher at <em>Forbes</em>, that has helped the company retain staff and improve performance.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Did we miss any must reads?

      "content": "<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>Having kicked off the Raines Partner Series with insights on why the Partner Track may (or may not) be right for you (&#8220;3 Questions to Consider Before Making Partner&#8221;), we now turn our attention to the various pros and cons to making Partner. We spoke with several executives to get a better understanding of the various rewards and challenges that accompany the position, highlighting some important factors to consider when stepping into the role.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>The Pros of Partnership</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Breadth of Projects and Experiences:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Dave Rickard, Executive Vice President, Strategy and Revenue Management for US Foods, was excited by the &#8220;turbo-charge&#8221; the learning environment gets when you make Partner.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Formerly a Partner at Boston Consulting Group, Dave explains, &#8220;The learning curve and the breadth of topics were very enjoyable. I was able to skim across a lot of different clients and see a lot of different things. And the global focus was particularly interesting. All of your firm-level activities are no longer regional, they’re all global.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Gil Krakowsky similarly notes, &#8220;I felt like I was absorbed in a broad array of things, many of which were things that really interested me. I felt like I had entrepreneurial control of what I wanted to do, and I felt like I was learning a lot.&#8221; Krakowsky made partner at A.T. Kearney and is Vice President, Global Strategy &amp; Business Development for The Gap, Inc.,</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><b>2. Increased Seniority</b><strong> &amp; Status:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">For Gil, one of the major pros of his Partner role was the opportunity of &#8220;being on the top of your profession and being acknowledged for that means something.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Elaborating on this point, he explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">&#8220;The pace of my career path kept me in the game. There was always the promise of another level of seniority, another bump in compensation, and another set of challenges. I could have more smart people under me filling in the blanks as I engaged with clients and helped innovate and structure solutions to problems.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">So as I got closer to the Partner point, I felt like I was absorbed in a broad array of things, many of which were things that really interested me. I felt like I had entrepreneurial control of what I wanted to do, and I felt like I was learning a lot.&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Like Gil, the opportunity for promotion and increased responsibility continually motivated Alison Levy, Group Vice President of Strategy of Ross Stores, Inc. and former Partner at Kurt Salmon, while embarking on the Partner path:</p>\n<p>&#8220;As I got more senior at each level, I would look at the people above me and knew I could achieve that,&#8221; Alison says. &#8220;I would ask, &#8216;What do I need to do to be at the next level or where do you see gaps?&#8217; I would close those gaps, and the promotions would follow. After a few years at the Manager level, I saw a clear path to Partner and that was exciting to me in many ways.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>3. Access to Senior Leadership, at home and in the field:</strong></p>\n<p>For Delaney Steele, the Partner role gave her ample opportunity to work with senior decision-makers within and outside of the firm.</p>\n<p>Delaney, Senior Vice President, Strategy &amp; Marketing for Ross Stores, Inc. and former Partner at Boston Consulting Group, &#8220;loved the increased access I had to senior clients.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You get that when you’re a Principal, but it’s of a different nature when you have the Partner title and the Partner position,&#8221; Delaney explains. &#8220;And I loved the intellectual leadership. I liked continuing to take what I did as a Principal to the next level, and feeling like I was really accountable for the answer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Being a Partner also allowed Delaney to get invested with people and projects. &#8220;I had a lot more information and a lot more power to help people in their careers,&#8221; she recalls.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>Cons of Making Partner</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em><strong>&#8230;there some things you should keep in the back of your mind&#8230;.</strong></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>1. Unpredictable schedule:</strong></p>\n<p>For Gil, one of the downsides of the Partner role was the continual &#8220;inconsistency and unpredictability of the work and the travel.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;When you’re a Manager,&#8221; he explains &#8220;you know you’re going to this client for 3-4 months, 3-4 days per week.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But, as a Partner at A.T. Kearney, Gil says he often was finding out about last minute travel or schedule changes that he had to manage alongside his regular work commitments.</p>\n<p>Like Gil, David admits that his &#8220;work-life balance continued to be a challenge&#8221; after stepping into the Partner role:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I certainly never worked less as a Partner, though I did have a little more control over that than I did as a Principal. And there were probably times were there is a degree of control that you give up on the day-to-day work – you’re not the one doing the model, you’re not the one making the presentation. You’re empowering your teams to get it all done, but ultimately you’re not in control. That’s a big change from when you were a Principal and the buck stopped with you and you wrote the final deck. So that is a mindset shift that takes some getting used to.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>2. Having to Compete with Partners instead of being Part of Projects:</strong></p>\n<p>The transition from Principal to Partner is notable, too, because you go from being called in to help partners to having to compete with those partners to keep your business.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When you’re a Principal the phone rings all the time,&#8221; Gil says. &#8220;All of the Partners want you to help make their business pursuits and projects successful.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But, when you become Partner, &#8220;the phone rings less.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You’re someone who potentially shares the credit if you’re brought in, and you’re certainly someone who burns through budget if you start showing up on the ground every day,&#8221; Gil explains. &#8220;There are many people who continue to see you as a collaborator, but there are some others who now see you as a bit of a threat.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>3. Emphasis on Sales:</strong></p>\n<p>When you become partner, Delaney Steele, Senior Vice President, Strategy &amp; Marketing for Ross Stores, Inc. explains: &#8220;The pressure is absolutely enormous to bring in revenue and build-out clients.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Because of that, there is a major transition to an emphasis on sales, which she said is &#8220;the single biggest different in the role between Principal and Partner.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Unless you’re someone who really likes to be in what is basically a sales-oriented role, it may not be a role that you like,&#8221; Delaney says. &#8220;I did not like it as much as I thought I would, because I really like content and problem-solving, but I did not like having to sell work.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Senior Vice President of Strategy &amp; Corporate Development for DocuSign, Dean Neese, agreed that &#8220;at the Partner level you are selling business as well.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Because of this additional dimension to the Partner role, he says, &#8220;Early on you either got it or you didn’t, but later it’s really about making the connections and relating to people. For making Partner, I think that the transition has been a hiccup for most folks.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Beyond weighing the costs and benefits of the Partner role, consider this final tip from Gil on determining whether the Partner path could be right for you:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;My strong recommendation for any Principal would be that very early in your Principal career, you should conduct that assessment and decide where you want to be in the near future, and what makes sense for you both professionally and personally.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>With these pros and cons in mind, we hope that assessment just became a little easier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">At one point or another, every consultant will ask themselves: &#8220;Do I want to make Partner?&#8221; While some may see themselves on the Partner Track starting Day One, for others the answer is not initially so clear.  Despite the various benefits associated with the Partner Track, (increased responsibility, value-added, and compensation, to name a few) the role is not the best move for everyone.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">So what do I need to know before pursuing the track to partnership?<em> </em>Raines International spoke with several executives about when their paths diverted from the Partner Track. Here are the key questions you should consider before seeking partnership.</p>\n<p><strong>1. What am I looking to get out of my consulting experience?</strong></p>\n<p><em>They say that after two years in consulting you’ve learned the foundations, and fundamentally I knew I didn’t want to go on to be a Partner. As great as BCG is, if you know you don’t want to be a Partner, you should pull the plug sooner rather than later and move on.   &#8212; </em>Arjun Moorthy, VP, Business Development &amp; Sales, HubSpot; Boston Consulting Group Alum</p>\n<p><em>At that time, I thought I would get the skills and then boogie on out of there. I definitely was not looking to stay and make Partner. At the end of the day, though, I didn’t know how long it would take for me to get the skills I was looking for and figure out what the next &#8216;next’ would be. That was a journey. &#8212; </em>Jessica Fortier, Senior Director, Logistics Strategy, Gap Inc.; Boston Consulting Group Alum</p>\n<p><em>I had a very good track-record at McKinsey. My client work was always rated at the absolute highest; I had a very good time with what I was doing on the client-side. But I was simply just not too interested in other aspects of the work at McKinsey&#8230;.. I think it was already clear in my head when I joined McKinsey that I needed to keep the door open. It was certainly clear I was not going to become a Partner at McKinsey. I figured that out very quickly, even before I joined the company, from talking with a lot of my friends from Kellogg who told me what they were doing. I knew from the beginning that I was not going to dedicate myself long-term to McKinsey. &#8212;</em> Laurent Borne, Global Vice President, Product Development Excellence, Whirlpool Corporation; McKinsey &amp; Company Alum</p>\n<p><em>As I got closer to the Principal level in consulting, the emphasis was primarily on selling work, and that wasn&#8217;t my favorite thing in the world to do. I knew that career wise I couldn&#8217;t ultimately be happy with the Partner role. &#8212;<a href=\"http://consultanttrack.com/profiles/brian-slobodow/\"> </a></em>Brian Slobodow, Operating Executive, Golden Gate Capital; A.T. Kearney Alum</p>\n<p><strong>2. What responsibilities are associated with the Partner role and will it be a fulfilling role for me?</strong></p>\n<p><em>No, I never considered Partner. Selling business wasn’t what excited me about consulting. I’m a business junkie – I like the art and science of business. In consulting I liked getting wide exposure to business at the start of my career. Eventually, however, I realized that while every consulting project is fun to talk about around the dinner table, every project is ultimately a bit of a grind when it comes time to do the work.  &#8212;</em>John Kimble, CFO, Mattel Consumer Products; Mars &amp; Co. Alum</p>\n<p><em>I never expected to stay as long as I did. It got very sticky. Toward the end, the last year or two, it was starting to become comfortable. When I thought about leaving I would start to think, “Oh I am giving up so much,” which was exactly the opposite of the kind of decision-making I wanted to have. I didn’t want to stay in a role just because it felt comfortable to leave or for a fear of the unknown. As it started to get really comfortable and became the path of least resistance, I promised myself, “I’ve got to at least look outside and make sure I am staying for the right reasons.” And it was really that, plus some changes on the personal front that led me to not want to travel as much. We had our first child and that made me start to think, “Well, let me at least just look,” because I wanted to make an informed decision. I was never one of those people gunning for Partner. Like many folks in these roles, I’m fairly driven but it wasn’t that I had to be in a certain role at a certain time or anything like that.  &#8212; </em>Heather Lord, SVP, Head of Strategy &amp; Innovation, Capital Group; Boston Consulting Group Alum</p>\n<p><strong>3. What are my chances of making Partner?</strong></p>\n<p><em>The pipeline to Partner was getting a little bit stuffed and it was going to take me longer than expected. I certainly got a little bit demotivated and demoralized by the idea of having to wait a little longer to be a Partner.  &#8212; </em>Nicolai Gerard, Digital Acceleration Officer, Groupe SEB; Bain &amp; Co. Alum</p>\n<p><em>I was always very direct with A.T. Kearney, and basically said, “Look, here is when I expect to make Partner. There is no up-or-out model here, but I see it as an up-or-out. If you don’t want me as a Partner on the basis of the performance I’ve laid out, then let’s just agree that you don’t want me as a Partner and I’ll go do something else.” I had that conversation a year-and-a-half out with a number of different people, and it wasn’t menacing or threatening. It was just, “Let’s be honest, here’s the performance, I believe it is Partner-level work. Either I’m totally delusional and you need to bring me back down to earth; or it is Partner-level work but you’re unwilling to make me a Partner for some other reason; or it is Partner-level work and at that point let’s just call it what it is.” Maybe others don’t have that conversation. It is also possible they aren’t in the position of strength to have that conversation. &#8212; </em>Gil Krakowsky, Vice President, Global Strategy &amp; Business Development, The Gap, Inc.; A.T. Kearney Alum</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, Partner, like any other professional opportunity, involves assessing the pros and cons of the role and a personal reflection on whether or not the role is right for you.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Whether you are on the Partner path or not, you never know when opportunities will surface and, as they come along, you assess each by its own merit,&#8221; Jaime Iredale, Global Head of Procurement, QBE Insurance; A.T. Kearney Alum, says.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<hr />\n<p>As an executive search firm, many of our conversations are dependent on the answer to a tell-all question: “What job title are you targeting?” Titles are an important recruitment tool and can make or break some candidates’ decisions based on their initial perception of a role.</p>\n<p>We often find that consultants transitioning into industry are just as concerned with their prospective title as they are with picking the right industry and corporate culture to move into.</p>\n<p>As far as a job title is concerned, Human Resources professionals and business leaders alike understand that a job title is necessary to help communicate how you fit into an organization, what you do, and your level of expertise or authority. Yet despite the necessary function of a job title, the purpose is somewhat deceiving.</p>\n<p>While there are many other components to take into account when considering a potential job opportunity, we cannot emphasize enough what is lost on the title alone.</p>\n<p>Put perfectly by our friend <strong>Aneesh Kumar Vice President of Enterprise Product Solutions</strong> at <strong>Cigna</strong> and former <strong>Engagement Manager</strong> at <strong>Booz &amp; Company</strong> (now <strong>Strategy&amp;</strong>) in one of our interviews:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;My advice would be to look at the role itself more than the title, which is purely a function of the company’s size and other more general factors. You want to focus on what kind of impact the role has on senior decision making, and if it has access to senior management.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>We know how much each individual devotes to his/her career, and the last thing we want to do is see you go into a role that is too junior and where you will get bored easily. That said, the things that will really impact your day-to-day satisfaction are what you are actually doing, what opportunities you will have, and if you’re being well compensated for it (which will come with its own trade-offs).</p>\n<p>Consider the following two scenarios:</p>\n<p><strong>Vice President at Company A ($2B in revenue):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reports to another Vice President, who reports to a divisional General Manager, who reports to an SVP, who reports to the CEO</li>\n<li>Compensation: $200k + 20% bonus target + $75k annual grant</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Director at Company B ($10B in revenue):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reports to the Chief Marketing Officer, who reports to the CEO</li>\n<li>Compensation: $225k + 35% bonus target + $150k annual grant</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Is the higher title really worth it? As with your favorite Mexican go-to, fajitas, make sure you are focusing on the substance (the meat of the position, the <strong>quality</strong> and <strong>path of the company</strong>, and the elements that matter the most in determining <strong>exit options</strong>) – not the sizzle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

It was a really interesting time to be in Asia – the financial economies were collapsing and there was very challenging work for us in helping large conglomerates optimize their corporate portfolios and restructure businesses. I felt like I was in “Lost in Translation” at times, but it taught me a lot about patience, and about being open minded to different cultures and people.</em></p>\n<p>Eng Tan, Vice President &amp; Head of Client Marketing at Asurion, LLC; Booz &amp; Company Alum</p>\n<p><strong>You will learn to be adaptable and flexible:</strong></p>\n<p><em>International exposure has had a huge impact on my career, and a good chunk of my experience has been outside of the U.S. I think that in order to work well internationally, you need to be both curious and humble, and assignments abroad are somewhat of a torture test for those two traits. You gain flexibility and an appreciation for diversity within a team, as most teams abroad have a broader spectrum of views, languages, etc., than U.S. teams have to offer.</em></p>\n<p>Andrew Bienkowski, Vice President &amp; Group Managing Director at S.C. Johnson &amp; Son; Accenture Alum</p>\n<p><em>If you’re in a senior position within a company that has an international business, it’s really hard to understand other cultures without experience making the adjustment to a different place and way of doing things. Visiting a country is very different than actually living and working there, so personal experience with that type of change and immersion is certainly valuable.</em></p>\n<p>Eng Tan, Vice President &amp; Head of Client Marketing at Asurion, LLC; Booz &amp; Company Alum</p>\n<p><strong>You will gain the insight necessary to be a well-informed business leader:</strong></p>\n<p><em>My international experience has 100% impacted my career. It is absolutely important to have that experience in today’s world &#8211; if you don’t, you will lack credibility and a context to make well-informed business decisions. Until you are outside of the U.S., you don’t really appreciate its size and importance; at the same time, you may also lack a knowledge of its flaws. Taken in terms of operating level, it is also critical at the senior ranks – when you are working with senior executives they want you to be able to talk the same game.</em></p>\n<p>Dave Kluz, Managing Director at Pernod Ricard SA; Boston Consulting Group Alum<em>belief, but I feel as though when you lack international experience you are left a bit more underdeveloped than you would be otherwise. My company operates on a “Think global, act local” mantra, and the leveraged learning you get from understanding economies of scale, etc., is key to what we do. To really be leaders nowadays, I think you have to take it global.</em></p>\n<p>Bruce Hawver, Chief Executive Officer at SteelSeries; McKinsey &amp; Company Alum</p>\n<p><em>In my own experience, I worked abroad in the earlier portion of my career, and I returned to the U.S. at a time when the domestic world was starting to develop the more matrixed and vague roles you see today. There was a need for people to influence organizations. My international roles were key in my ability to have that influence, because I had been working with people in Europe in these types of global roles that the U.S. was just developing. It was as though I had gotten to pilot test it.</em></p>\n<p>Andrew Bienkowski, Vice President &amp; Group Managing Director at S.C. Johnson &amp; Son; Accenture Alum</p>\n<p><strong>It can accelerate your career towards senior-level executive positions:</strong></p>\n<p><em>If you’re actually thinking of your career more broadly, I think [an international consulting assignment] helps, because bringing geographic diversity to your curriculum is now a must-have for any kind of C-level executive position. There are more and more positions now, especially at the GM level, for which experience on at least two, if not three, continents, is required. And just Europe and the US are almost not good enough now. You need to have Europe, the US, and probably Asia or Africa to be relevant. </em></p>\n<p>Nicolai Gerard, Digital Acceleration Officer at Groupe SEB; Bain &amp; Company Alum</p>\n<p><strong>…But it could hinder your career progression if you are in consulting for the long-haul:</strong></p>\n<p><em>It certainly hurts if you’re aiming for Partnership, because at a point — probably when you reach the Manager level — if you’re serious about making it to Partner you’ll want to capitalize on your network locally. </em></p>\n<p>Nicolai Gerard, Digital Acceleration Officer at Groupe SEB; Bain &amp; Company Alum</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These former consultants pursued international opportunities during their management consulting careers and gained a bettering understanding of the international factors shaping their and their clients’ businesses. While an international experience may not fit into your current career trajectory, the benefits of a global mindset, an international network of contacts, and exposure to emerging global markets helped each of these consultants leverage his international experience towards his current senior-level executive role.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<div class=\"profile-intro\">\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">Position: Global VP, Product Dev Excellence</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">Current Firm: Whirlpool</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>Post-undergrad, you spent a number of years in a variety of engineering roles before landing at Delphi. Can you tell us about your early career with the automotive supplier?</em></p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">\n</div>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">The opportunity came about when I finished my national service, which I completed by working in the United States for a French auto supplier. I had to go back to France at the end of my service and I was looking for an engineering position with a company that worked in engine management systems or anything related to engines or vehicles. I interviewed with multiple companies and at the time Delphi had just acquired Lucas Diesel based out of France and the UK to develop some new engine systems technology, so they were hiring engineers like crazy. I liked the fact that it was a U.S. &#8211; based company because I knew that I wanted to go back to the U.S. permanently. So the technical challenge alongside the potential to come back to the U.S. in the future made the position very attractive to me and compelled me to take that first role with Delphi.</p>\n<div class=\"profile-intro\">\n<div class=\"profile-intro\">\n<p><em>And you did end up in the U.S., completing your Master of Engineering and MBA at Northwestern in 2007. Considering your engineering background, the M.E. makes sense, but what about the MBA?</em></p>\n<p>The MBA became a priority for me only in 2003. When I was in engineering school, I was seeing myself as a very technical person, so I loaded up on very technical classes with minimal attention to leadership or management electives. After I got to Delphi and began doing very well there, I came to a crossroads that probably many engineers run into at some point in their career: technical expertise or management? And I reached that crossroads faster than I expected when I was about 25. I chose to go down the path of managing a team and managing projects, still obviously situating myself in the technical world, but with a lot more going on than just technical activities. Very soon I came to like it and I realized there were many fundamental things that I didn’t know. As I got to meet more and more Delphi executives, I realized most of them had an MBA. And that was a gap for me that I decided to close. So I applied to business schools in the U.S. and ended up going to Northwestern University as a Delphi Fellow and that is why I went back to Delphi after my MBA.</p>\n<p><em>Did you entertain any other professional opportunities post-MBA or did you always have your mind set on going back to Delphi following your time at Northwestern?</em></p>\n<p>I did not look for opportunities outside of Delphi while I was in my MBA program. However, some employers are amazingly gifted at finding your resume. So I was contacted by several companies because at this point I had seven years of professional experience in engineering and manufacturing. I had managed large projects; I had managed large groups of engineers and other employees; I was an interesting commodity for several employers. But while I was approached by several companies during my MBA program I did not follow through past early informal discussions with one major exception: McKinsey.</p>\n<p>Delphi had always been good to me. I had had a lot of opportunities with them: a lot of opportunities to grow, a lot of opportunities to work on great projects with a huge business, a lot of opportunities to be mentored, to gain new training, etc. However, Delphi filed for bankruptcy between the first and second year of my MBA and as that played out I was concerned about what would happen after my MBA. In my mind, it was always clear that if I felt confident that Delphi would not be liquidated, and if they had some interesting work for me after completing my MBA, I would go back. When they offered an assignment in finance to work on the bankruptcy, I realized it’s was a good way to not go back immediately to work in a purely operational role, but to learn something new and capitalize on my MBA. So as soon as Delphi came back to me with a full-time offer I knew it was the right thing to do to go back.</p>\n<p><em>After another year and a half with Delphi, you left the company to join McKinsey. When did management consulting get on your radar and why did you join the firm?</em></p>\n<p>Considering the context of the bankruptcy, my mentor from Delphi advised me to work on a backup plan in case the Delphi bankruptcy went poorly. I didn’t really know McKinsey before going to business school, but when I got to Northwestern I realized every single student there was interested in joining McKinsey. So I thought “Wow, I should learn more about McKinsey!”. I applied to McKinsey during my second year at Kellogg and eventually turned down their offer when I decided to go back to Delphi. We stayed in touch and when the conditions were right 2 years after my completing my MBA, I joined McKinsey’s Chicago Office as part of the operations practice.</p>\n<p><em>Did you join the firm as part of a general post-MBA class or as an experienced hire, given your professional experience post-MBA?</em></p>\n<p>I was hired into the operations practice and joined as an experienced professional. I joined in October, the same day as a lot of students fresh out of business school, but I was an experienced hire considering my then almost 10 years of professional experience.</p>\n<p><em>What was the transition like from industry to management consulting given your extensive background in engineering roles? Were there any surprises or challenges?</em></p>\n<p>To be completely honest, my first three months at McKinsey were a little challenging for me. I questioned whether or not I would really fit in at McKinsey. First and foremost, I had more experience than many of my colleagues and I had learned how to do things a certain way. When you get to McKinsey, they “force” you to kind of un-learn what you became used to before and to re-learn their specific problem-solving approach, their communications frameworks and how they do things. Besides, in consulting, you are less hands-on with your approach and your process. You are trained to think through a problem deeply and to come up with some recommendations and a solution, but you are not necessarily executing anything.</p>\n<p>Very early on there were moments where I could have really jumped on and tackled a problem and driven actions for immediate execution rather than waiting to make a nice, concise recommendation at the end like I was being trained to do. There were many moments where I would have handled a situation or a problem differently if I had been on the client team as opposed to being a consultant.</p>\n<p>There were also some really good aspects. I worked with people of different backgrounds and profiles than myself. Previously, all of the people I had worked with until then had the same profile. They were mostly engineers like myself: they were passionate about and fascinated by the product. And then on my third day at McKinsey, I am sitting with maybe a couple of engineers and everyone else had completely different backgrounds: folks with Private Equity or M&amp;A experience, background in investment banking or marketing…and my head almost exploded! This experience opened up a lot of questions that I thought I had sorted before.</p>\n<p><em>So it seems like you knew you wanted to get back into a more hands-on product-focused role pretty early on.</em></p>\n<p>I think it was already clear in my head when I joined McKinsey that I needed to keep the door open. It was certainly clear I was not going to become a Partner at McKinsey. I figured that out very quickly, even before I joined the company, from talking with a lot of my friends from Kellogg who told me what they were doing. I knew from the beginning that I was not going to dedicate myself long-term to McKinsey.</p>\n<p>I had a very good track-record at McKinsey. My client work was always rated at the absolute highest; I had a very good time with what I was doing on the client-side. But I was simply just not too interested in other aspects of the work at McKinsey. For example, the recruiting side of things: rushing to a university or another on a Thursday night upon returning home to try and convince MBA students to join. Also, I wasn’t interested in going to the office on a Friday afternoon and trying to network with everyone to secure a spot on the next great project… that’s just not who I am. So it became obvious to me that the informal rules of the land were not necessarily for me.</p>\n<p>That being said, I obviously wanted to benefit from and get the most out of my time with the firm, to learn many things that would eventually come in handy later when I would go back to an industry role. So I focused on my client work, I focused on learning a lot of things revolving around communication, around developing cross-functional, enterprise-wide solutions to a problem, forcing myself to think at a higher level. As great as McKinsey is as an institution and as a place to work, I knew I would not try to go any higher than an Engagement Manager-level and knew that if an interesting and good opportunity came along at any point I would leave.</p>\n<p><em>So when did the opportunity at Whirlpool come about?</em></p>\n<p>I got a call from a headhunter and the proposition was very intriguing. He told me essentially that his contact at Whirlpool, who at the time was the President of North America, but was looked upon as the next CEO by many observers, was looking to bring new people with a lot of runway to move quickly into VP roles and above. He wanted to hire these individuals as Directors and accelerate their careers through coaching, mentoring and stretching assignments. After talking to a few people in my network and after interviewing at the company I realized that there were a lot of exciting things happening at the company and decided to make the jump back into the industry.</p>\n<p><em>What was most important to you when evaluating the post-consulting opportunity at Whirlpool?</em></p>\n<p>When the opportunity presented itself to join Whirlpool, there were a number of things that were compelling me to take the role. Firstly, the position was a manufacturing role on a large scale and I would be overseeing a large and diverse organization: engineers, technicians, supervisors, team leaders, operators, etc. Secondly, the product was interesting and meaningful for consumers. Thirdly, the appliance industry was nothing like what I was used to in the automotive industry in terms of industrial sophistication, but there was a realization at Whirlpool of this existing gap and a lot of people there were very motivated and dedicated to changing that status quo. I saw all those things as potential opportunities to learn and grow as well as to prove to myself that I could drive change from within the company as opposed to as an outsider from McKinsey.</p>\n<p><em>When the opportunity at Whirlpool arose, you had a long track record in engineering and experience working in a top-tier management consulting firm post-MBA. What was the transition like moving from Chicago with McKinsey to working at a 2,200-employee refrigeration plant in Amana, Iowa with Whirlpool?</em></p>\n<p>Frustrating at the beginning for sure. Very frustrating because there were a lot of things I took for granted in terms of the analytical skills of the people around me, in terms of their ability to properly structure a problem, their autonomy in doing things. When I got to Amana I didn’t see those things right away. The first few months were frustrating, but you have to keep in mind that, when stepping into a new senior position, people are looking after you to be a role model, they are deciding whether they want to follow you or not. So you cannot express that frustration too much, otherwise, you are going to lose your team.</p>\n<p>What I had to do was simply slow down, even though there were some things that I knew could have been done at a much faster pace. I had to do this to give the time needed by my team to understand where I was going and what potential I was seeing. To achieve some of this, I had to put in the time to work one-on-one with many people on my team in order to build some new skills that were missing at the time. I did a lot of coaching, a lot of training regarding how to look at a problem from a different angle, deciding what data you really need to make a decision so you can spend less time and resource and move faster. With this type of commitment to developing your team, the engagement of the team increased quickly. I quickly transitioned from frustration to excitement. You start getting the types of responses that you expect, the different parts start moving in tandem, and you see the excitement in your team because they are buying into what you want to do. You can read in their eyes: “Hey, that guy might actually know what he is doing.”</p>\n<p>Also, in terms of leadership, leading people on a shop floor, who didn’t see what was in front of them as a career, but only as a way to collect a paycheck to support their families, was a very, very interesting challenge. Figuring out ways to motivate these people… that is something that honestly you don’t have in consulting.</p>\n<p><em>Do you think your time at McKinsey accelerated your career trajectory at Whirlpool? In hindsight, was that year and a half at McKinsey instrumental to your success? Or could you just as easily have transitioned to Whirlpool from Delphi?</em></p>\n<p>I think I could have made the jump from Delphi to Whirlpool because we hire a lot of people from the automotive industry without consulting experience at my company and they tend to do very well. I do believe, however, that the time I spent at McKinsey, especially working for and with a specific Partner, has been instrumental in my success at Whirlpool, without a doubt. The way he forced me to generate insights, to focus on actionable solutions to problems, to structure my communication so that I would be much more able to convince senior executives to execute my recommendations… it was all so crucial. There are things that you learn at the firm, things you spend countless hours working on and you don’t know what it will amount to at the end, but it all definitely builds you as an executive and as a person. While I could have made the jump from Delphi to Whirlpool without my McKinsey experience, I don’t know if I would have been as successful as I have been.</p>\n<p><em>Now as Whirlpool’s Global Vice President of Product Development, you have had a great trajectory after only four years with the company. At what point did the growth opportunities appear?</em></p>\n<p>First, to create opportunities for yourself, you have to deliver. So I focused on doing well in my first couple of roles: making a positive difference, creating a followership, bringing thought leadership to my organization…</p>\n<p>Second, you need to understand how the organization works, what the different roles are and what makes people successful in the different parts of the organization. You also need to understand the dynamics of what is happening in the organization and what you think is going to be the next strategic priority for the organization. Are you a good match for a key strategic priority of the company’s? For me, it was clear when I came to Whirlpool that product development would become our next frontier to conquer. The product at this time was becoming more and more important: because of increased competition, the product lifecycle was shortening quickly. Product development is my passion, I think I am good at it so there was good alignment between the company’s goals and my career interests!</p>\n<p>Third, you need help to make decision makers know what you want to do and that you can be an asset in this role. And this is why a mentor is so important because, as you can imagine, starting with the organization by working for two years in the middle of Iowa… nobody knew me in the headquarters of Whirlpool! So you have to find yourself a mentor, someone who is going to be a champion for your success, help you move into the right places, get the right experiences to prepare yourself. If you have those three things –track record, sponsorship and clarity of thought as to what you want- when a new opportunity opens up your name appears at the top of the list.</p>\n<p><em>From a career management perspective, was the path always clear to your current role? Did you ever arrive at a crossroads where you would have considering taking yourself off the path?</em></p>\n<p>There were opportunities that came about in the last five years, some that I did look at very closely. There was one point in particular where I had a great opportunity to take on a very interesting role in an industry that was never on my radar. Probably a lot of people would say that everything was there to make it work: role, location, timing, package&#8230; At that time, I could not make myself comfortable with the industry. I was afraid that it wasn’t going to be a good match in the long run and that eventually, I would not like the field I had stepped into. So I didn’t take the role.</p>\n<p>There was another time where I evaluated an external opportunity that came from a good friend of mine. He was my mentor at Delphi and he contacted me to join him and help him in his new role. That one was extremely difficult to pass on from a personal standpoint. At the time there were a lot of good things happening at Whirlpool though and I wanted to see them through and to finish what I had started so I had to turn him down.</p>\n<p><em>What are the most important skills you have picked up that make up the recipe for success for a Global VP at a $20bn+ company? Are there any general career management tips you can share or insights on your lessons learned?</em></p>\n<p>That’s a tough one. In the context of giving guidance to current and former consultants who might consider going back to industry, I think that my big learning experience during these last six or seven years is this: regardless of what people say you should or shouldn’t do, at the end it comes down to what you personally think you can achieve. I don’t think there is such a thing as a golden path to success. A lot of people told me I was leaving McKinsey too early, that I wasn’t going to get the full benefits of the consulting experience because I didn’t wait to make it to the Engagement Manager level, or that I should have left Whirlpool when one of those opportunities was presented to me. It is all about you, your passion, your hard work, and what you are delivering. And if at the end you are thinking about those things, I think wherever you go, provided you are doing something you like, you are going to be successful. Could I have done better outside of Whirlpool? Maybe. Am I happy with what I have accomplished at Whirlpool? Yes, I am very comfortable with it and I am very happy with my experiences.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

      "content": "<hr />\n<p>In 2015, Chris Louie, a former McKinsey &amp; Company Engagement Manager, found himself accepting a role as Nielsen’s new SVP of Talent Acquisition after five years of corporate experience in senior Strategy, Product, and Marketing &amp; Sales roles. Yet his decision to lead the global Talent Acquisition team of a $6b+ company was met with confusion: why take an HR job? When Laszlo Bock, Google’s current SVP of People Operations left McKinsey in 2003 to accept a VP, Compensation &amp; Benefits role at GE Capital, his transition was seen as similarly uncharacteristic of the traditional management consultant trajectory from consulting to a corporate strategy team:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>“My colleagues in consulting thought I was committing professional suicide….At the time, there were more than five thousand people in McKinsey’s database of alumni, but only a hundred of them were in human resources, virtually all working as consultants for other firms or recruiters. I reasoned that my training and background would make me stand out in the HR talent pool and help me come up with novel solutions. And maybe, just maybe, that would help me have a faster career trajectory than waiting twenty or thirty years to creep up the corporate ladder. I might get into a place where I could impact more people, faster.”</em></p></blockquote>\n<h6><em>–</em> Laszlo Bock. <em>Work Rules! Insights from Inside Google That Will Transform How You Live and Lead </em>(2015)</h6>\n<p>As an executive search firm, we find that clients across various industries and functions are eager to hire current and former management consultants to join their organizations. Yet despite the importance of HR in creating a competitive organization, few consultants step into roles outside of a company’s strategy function or internal consulting group, let alone HR. “There’s undeniably still a stigma around Human Resources in the business world,” says Louie in <em>Why I ‘Took a HR Job,</em> published on the exec’s personal LinkedIn in August 2015. “One external recruiter I spoke with summarized this best when I ran the opportunity by him: ‘The pros are that you would be part of a new generation of HR leaders; the cons are the HR is still dramatically underpaid and disrespected as a function!’”</p>\n<p>While only a small percentage of management consultants have thus far moved into corporate HR, careers like Louie’s, Bock’s, and other former consultants make one thing clear: Human Resources is evolving into a fertile ground where former consultants can leverage their expertise to execute high-impact initiatives that drive corporate growth and development. HR is undergoing a transformation, and as an increasing number of HR organizations look to recruit former consultants to fill their executive roles, it begs the question: Why <em>shouldn’t</em> you consider taking an HR role once you decide to leave consulting? Read on to hear Chris’ thoughts on misinformed HR stereotypes, how companies can get HR right, and why an HR role could be the right move for former consultants looking to make the highest impact in their future industry role.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>As published on </em><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-i-took-hr-job-chris-louie?trk=mp-reader-card\"><em>LinkedIn</em></a><em>, August 19, 2015</em></p>\n<p>By Chris Louie, SVP of Talent Acquisition at Nielsen</p>\n<blockquote><p>“…The stereotype of HR in many companies is that of the most corporate of corporate functions.  They are the purveyors of empty corporate mantras destined to be affixed to corporate schlock, and the initiators of initiatives that will quickly be abandoned when the next management fad hits.  They create arcane rules and regulations seemingly designed to mystify, delay, and torture.  It’s figuratively and literally “back office” (windows optional).  They are NOT George Clooney’s character in the movie “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsRP9EUrXjo\">Up In The Air</a>,” who endlessly travels from location to location to carry out “rightsizing” efforts… they’re the people that hire him.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So… why DID I take an HR job?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>I think HR gets a bum rap</strong></p>\n<p>Detach any function from the business, and it will significantly diminish its effectiveness. Without understanding how you make money, you can’t tailor your priorities in a way that contributes to the overall business objectives of the company.</p>\n<p>Instead, all you can do is focus on your own functional goals; and perversely the harder you push against them, the more you might inadvertently gum up the core business.  New cash collection policies from Finance could tick off big clients.  The glossy campaign from Marketing may be tone-deaf on a major commercial push.  The best practice performance assessment system HR just rolled out might penalize your best salespeople.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, companies have probably fallen into this trap more with HR than any other function, likely due to the presumption that it’s inherently inward-facing.</p>\n<p>I think that’s wrong-headed…I believe HR’s greatest responsibility is to maintain and continually strengthen the lifeblood of a company: its talent.  If they’re not tapping the pulse of the market directly, HR won’t be able to help bring the right additional talent onto the team.  And without a strong understanding of what people developing and selling our solutions are facing and how they’re serving clients on a daily basis, HR won’t be able to help the talent already on the team succeed in their current roles and continue to grow their careers.</p>\n<p>There’s an apparent trend of companies starting to “get it,” particularly the startups and stalwarts competing in the hyper-competitive job market of Silicon Valley.  The abandonment of the “Human Resources” moniker in favor of “People Operations” (e.g., Google), “Global Talent Organization” (e.g., LinkedIn), and “Human Capital” (e.g., Goldman) speaks to this.  While potentially superficial, it signals an important mindset change away from HR as a cost center managing people as supplies, and toward HR being an integral part of what it takes to make your company run and drive profit and growth.</p>\n<p><strong>….Helping get our talent right is probably the highest impact thing I can do today</strong></p>\n<p>….We can spend all the time we want developing the most compelling product plans and investing in a cutting-edge tech stack.  Absent the talent to take us from concept to creation to execution for the end-client, all we’ll be left with is good intentions.  In fact, talent may actually trump strategy and tech bona fides, as talent has the capability to close gaps in these areas; it doesn’t work the other way around.  HR can be the driving force behind a winning team.  We can help field the team- not just with the “best athletes,” but ones who bring out the best in each other and help the team, our clients, and our partners become better and stronger.</p>\n<p>….We have a lot of the right talent at Nielsen.  I’ve seen this with my own eyes, in the product dev and client delivery trenches.  But we need more of it.  And the type of talent we need to recruit- technical, entrepreneurial, diverse, millennial- is the same type that everyone else needs as well, because they’re facing the same macro-level changes.</p>\n<p><strong>That’s the challenge.</strong></p>\n<p>But it’s also what makes the prospect of being at the forefront of this talent drive compelling for me.  I’ve always been motivated by the ability to have meaningful, lasting impact.  And the criticality of getting our talent right coupled with the degree of difficulty associated with the effort have convinced me that this is the highest impact thing I can take on right now.</p>\n<p><strong>I’m passionate enough about talent management to make it my day job</strong></p>\n<p>Throughout my time at Nielsen, I’ve found myself creating ways to advance our talent management efforts.  Admittedly, most of these constituted benign plagiarism- borrowing from things I’d seen at other places and adapting them for what would work best at Nielsen.  These included the creation of an <a href=\"https://alumni.nielsen.com/\">alumni network</a>, the launch of a “TechTalk” external speaker series, and a small trial run at applying a rigorous scoring system for undergrad resume screening.</p>\n<p>Despite my lack of originality, I reveled in seeing the impact from these efforts, especially as some of them started to scale.  It was rewarding… and a lot of fun.</p>\n<p>When the Talent Acquisition opportunity arose, it made me reflect on the experiences I’d had with talent management which shaped my own career… And it made me think, with the combination of a compulsion toward talent management, a somewhat unique set of experiences in the area, and now a great opportunity, “Maybe there’s something here…”</p>\n<p><strong>Despite coming to the points above fairly quickly, I still struggled for a while with this decision.</strong>  The more linear next move for me would have been to take on a big product or commercial role.  I worried about getting typecast as an “HR guy” and limiting my prospects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What ultimately got me over the hump? </strong></p>\n<p>I stopped thinking about the career risks of taking on the role and started thinking about the upsides:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An outsize impact on our company’s prospects, by shaping something that touches every part of what we do: our talent;</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The chance to stretch myself in a number of ways: a completely new function, a new org and team, global scope;</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The opportunity to focus on something for which I have a lot of passion;</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Our CEO, CHRO and other senior leaders’ willingness to spend time with me to share their view of what this role means to Nielsen, what opportunity this presented to me, and how they would invest time to prioritize our talent effort.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any of these four things in isolation would make the role interesting.  Together, they made it one that I couldn’t pass up.  I’ll worry about the future and how some faceless LinkedIn voyeurs end up perceiving my career arc later.</p>\n<p>I don’t know whether I’ll end up in HR long-term.  Maybe I’ll love it and stay; maybe I won’t, in which case I’m reasonably confident that I’ll be able to find something great outside of the function.  I won’t be sure until I’ve spent significant time on the team, in the thick of the effort.  Regardless of which way I go, hopefully by then my work on talent will have made a mark.</p>\n<p>However, one thing I am certain of is that I’m excited and honored to be taking on this “HR job” right now.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<hr />\n<p><em>Raines International interviewed many former consultants in different industries and functional areas for this article, some of whom have full interviews on Raines Perspectives. Those contributors and links to their full interviews can be found at the end of this article.</em></p>\n<blockquote><p>____________________</p>\n<p>“Onboarding is the process by which new hires get adjusted to the social and performance aspects of their jobs quickly and smoothly, and learn the attitudes, knowledge, skills, and behaviors required to function effectively within an organization.” – Society for Human Resources Management Foundation</p>\n<p>____________________</p></blockquote>\n<p>The first thing consultants might think when they hear the term “Onboarding” is the indoctrination they went through when entering their consulting firm.  But what does it mean when you are the person onboarding to a new firm after leaving consulting?</p>\n<p>Every onboarding experience is unique — not only among firms and hiring managers, but also among new hires. Therefore, there is no “one size fits all” onboarding process to rely on. And in reality, most companies don’t offer much by way of onboarding at all.  In practice, attention to the thoughtful onboarding of a new hire is treated as “nice to have” by companies, often with disastrous consequences.  So what does this mean? That as a new hire, you need to do the heavy lifting to guarantee a successful onboarding experience.</p>\n<p>As an executive search firm, it pains us when we find ourselves on the receiving end of calls and emails from people in our network who have just joined companies and are concerned that they’ve made the wrong move just a few months into a new position.  With that in mind, regardless of the specific environment, Raines International has boiled down four key tips to improve your onboarding experience.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Confirm what is expected</strong></p>\n<p>Hopefully, you’ve gotten an idea of clear benchmarks and expectations during the interview process so you know what you signed up for. But if that somehow wasn’t covered, before your first day or early on in your new role, ask your hiring manager questions like: What is my first month or year going to look like? What would constitute a successful quarter? What do you think will be major struggles? Has this company previously hired consultants and how has that worked?</p>\n<p>Part of this is tied to the environment you are entering. Are you joining a start-up or an established business? Is the business going through a turnaround or a growth period?</p>\n<p>Depending on those answers, you may want to find out if there are any issues you should avoid or skeletons in the closet. This also will shape your first weeks — do you have the luxury of taking time to intimately learn the business and identify areas for growth from the get go, or do you need to be more hands on in a turnaround and stop the bleeding.</p>\n<p><b>2. Adapt to your new environment and culture</b></p>\n<p>It seems obvious, but many consultants moving into new companies forget that they are no longer consultants. As a consultant, you know how to stand out, but now you need to fit in.</p>\n<p>“Whereas in consulting, you almost have to prove to your client that you’re smarter than they are so they keep hiring you,” says Brian Slobodow, an Operating Executive with Golden Gate Capital, “you can alienate co-workers with that approach. Even if you have consulted for your new company or worked in that particular industry, you often know much less than you think you do.”</p>\n<p>Onboarding is a time to understand the nuances of your business, which will give credibility to your solutions later on, Alison Levy, Group Vice President of Strategy with Ross Stores, points out. Acting as if you have all the answers because you’ve seen it all before will cripple, not enable, your ability to lead. True Value Chief Operating Officer Abhinav Shukla suggests that humbly building a common agenda will make people appreciate the analytics and knowledge of “best-in-class” practices that you bring from your consulting.</p>\n<p>It’s not just your working style that may change. Be mindful of interpersonal reactions and the work environment. Observe how people dress and act in meetings, and be particularly sensitive to the pace of work — the round-the-clock schedule of consulting may be out of place. Drop the consulting jargon and don’t be a know-it-all. In a nutshell: Listen and learn.</p>\n<p><b>3. Communicate and build a team</b></p>\n<p>You aren’t an outsider anymore. Now you need to reduce the distance between yourself and the company and create relationships that will help you do your job successfully. If you have consulted for the company before, make sure you re-introduce yourself and make it clear that you are one of the team and not “the ex-consultant we just hired,” advises Golden Gate Capital’s Slobodow.</p>\n<p>Onboarding is a time to ask lots of questions and position yourself as someone who wants to learn from the team.  Consultants sometimes fail because they gravitate toward working with leaders and managers instead of recognizing they need to rely on their team as their resource.</p>\n<p>Not only will you need the assistance from your team, you will also need the assistance of diverse sectors of the company to accomplish your goals. For instance, if you are entering product management, Symantec Vice President of Product Management, Alejandro Borgia, says, “You need to be very tight with your engineering lead and engineering team…get to know them. Work with them closely. Earn their trust. Make best friends with [them],” he advises.</p>\n<p>If you have the time, shadow various members of your organization to learn the importance of their roles, no matter how big or small the position. You never know when you will need their expertise. If you make the effort to get down to the plant floor as your projects or position demand, forming these strong connections with operators and administrative staff will ensure your success, Brian Slobodow from Golden Gate Capital recommends.</p>\n<p>Establishing relationships and building a “network of alliances” will be critical to your success as you enter your new company. “The idea is … to engage with each one on common values: respect, teamwork, integrity, and a drive to succeed,” Shukla of True Value says.</p>\n<p>Lastly, from the Boston Consulting Group Career Services team, “It’s important to recognize some basic differences between consulting and working in industry.  Consultants can be quite intellectual in how they focus on content, process and projects.  They come into a client firm with a certain authority to produce solutions. However, as a new employee in industry, it helps to recognize the value of taking time to build internal relationships and learn the new culture.   Most importantly, it takes time to understand the internal politics.   Begin your new industry job by building internal relationships and a reputation of trust to enhance your success in initiating change.”</p>\n<p><b>4. Identify areas for impact, and learn how to implement</b></p>\n<p>Consultants are often used to devising great strategies for a client, but are not often tasked with implementing and seeing a project through.  Consultants have to execute and take responsibility for the results. “The rigor and depth required in executing versus providing advice are totally different ball games,” Symantec’s Borgia explains.</p>\n<p>Implementation may require skill sets you don’t possess. For example, Arjun Moorthy, HubSpot Vice President of Business Development, discovered that he was in a position that included a “sales element,” which he feels is often an element of an operational role, whether “you are directly selling the product, or you are selling candidates to join the team, or you are selling the management team on a new idea.” You have to be prepared to dig in and correct these deficiencies.</p>\n<p>From the start, use your consultant mindset to analyze what the big issues or problem areas are and identify where you can deliver the most impact, Symantec’s Borgia advises. In a best case scenario, your hiring manager will structure an “easy project” that you likely will be able to hit out of the park.  The project should only take a couple of months and it will allow you to learn some element of the business.</p>\n<p>A well-defined smaller project can also provide an opportunity to gain input from your Manager about how to address projects and delineate expectations.</p>\n<p>If that’s not available, create your own project, like Heather Lord, Senior Vice President of Strategy &amp; Client Experience at Charles Schwab, who set up her own 90-day plan at Schwab to pinpoint goals and track her progress and development.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Position: Group Vice President, Strategy</p>\n<p>Current Firm: Ross Stores, Inc.</p>\n<p><em class=\"profile-intro\">You spent your pre-MBA days in a variety of roles at top retailers. After graduating business school, what led you into consulting and Kurt Salmon specifically?</em></p>\n<p>At business school, I quickly honed in on the fact that I loved the retail work from my pre-MBA days, and I wanted to stick to that, but at the time virtually no retailers offered MBA internships. I thought Kurt Salmon would be something I would do for the summer to build my resume before going back into industry, but I fell in love with it. I remember being in a Steering Committee meeting my first week that summer and the CEO turned to me and said, “Oh, you’re the intern who worked at Bloomingdale’s. What do you think of our product at Bloomingdale’s?” Immediately, I saw that in consulting you could have a dialogue with C-level executives, you were constantly progressing through projects, and solving problems at a rapid pace, which was really exciting to me.</p>\n<p>I went to Kurt Salmon specifically because of my passion for retail. Consulting wasn’t really something I explored with all the big firms. My personality lends itself to more operational consulting, and Kurt Salmon is known for that in the market, which translates very well to my role at Ross. But more on that later…</p>\n<p><em>So you loved the problem solving and the diverse projects, but what really kept you there for almost 10 years to Partner?</em></p>\n<p>When I joined I told myself I’d only do it for one or two years, but I loved it, and it’s really exciting to be at a job you love, so work became fun. It was the first time in my life where I could really see that work isn’t something you have to do; working is something you want to do. The nature of the projects, the sharp people, and the enjoyment I was getting from this strategic consulting role led me to stay. I don’t know that I ever said, “I must make Partner.” In fact, I would say that was never a goal for me, but I wanted to continue to do well and be promoted. As I got more senior at each level, I would look at the people above me and knew I could achieve that. I would ask, “What do I need to do to be at the next level or where do you see gaps?” I would close those gaps, and the promotions would follow. After a few years at the Manager level, I saw a clear path to Partner and that was exciting to me in many ways.</p>\n<p><em>Why did you decide to leave? How did you learn about the opportunity at Ross, and what made it so appealing?</em></p>\n<p>I started to consider other opportunities at a point where my family situation changed. Consulting is really fun and dynamic, but I have never seen it in any context across any firm where it isn’t also extremely intense. The more senior you get, the more intense it becomes. You don’t really give up responsibilities – you just take on additional ones and you take them more seriously because you are a shareholder in the firm and you are responsible for driving your own revenue. As a Partner, there were so many more competing demands on my time right when I had my first child. I realized that perhaps I would look back at this point in my life and not feel good about how I was prioritizing my commitments.</p>\n<p>I cultivated strong relationships at all of my clients, and Delaney Steele (SVP Strategy and Marketing at Ross) was certainly one of them. I saw her as a role model who was on a similar path as me and had seen her leave a Partner role at BCG and head to Ross. It seemed like a great move for her, and as I got more serious about wanting to rebalance my life, I couldn’t help but wonder whether it could be the right move for me as well. Of course, Ross would never have solicited me, so I approached them, which led to a number of rapid discussions with the entire Executive team. The whole thing happened very quickly, but with each conversation, I felt more certain that this was exactly what I was looking for. I continue to feel so grateful that things unfolded as they did. The lesson here is that the relationships you cultivate while on the consulting side are extremely valuable and powerful in helping you find opportunities. Additionally, the quality of your work really speaks for itself in people wanting you to join their company and seeing the value you can bring.</p>\n<p><em>What tips do you have for people onboarding at Ross and at a new company more broadly?</em></p>\n<p>At Ross, onboarding is about listening and learning, but not doing. Onboarding is a unique opportunity where you have time to learn and explore, so you should take that very seriously. Ross is a culture that promotes that, but even if you end up in a culture that doesn’t promote it as intuitively, make sure you approach it that way yourself. Even after 18 months at Ross, I am constantly learning new things that shape how I craft a solution. I may have seen a similar problem numerous times in consulting, but nuanced things that are unique to Ross make me answer it differently in my new role. So take the time to absorb as much as you can about your new company, both the big or obvious characteristics as well as the more nuanced or cultural details. It will strengthen your credibility throughout the organization, as they see the work you put forth account for what you’ve learned.</p>\n<p>Additionally, spot people who you view as successful at the company and create a ‘short-list’ of people worth getting to know. Just like in consulting, your network is powerful, so cultivating those relationships is important. Similarly, people who are well respected or highly successful can give you invaluable advice, tips, and guidance for what to steer towards and away from.</p>\n<p><em>On the other side of that coin, do you have any across-the-board don’ts?</em></p>\n<p>Watch out for “consultant speak” and the air in which you carry yourself. For example, don’t talk about where you got your MBA or the fact that you worked at a Hedge Fund if you’re at a retailer where people grew up in the garment industry. Tune into your audience and position yourself in a way that makes you feel closest to them or most like them. Consultants are often trained to go into a company and reflect as super smart in order to prove their worth. The tables really turn in corporate. Try to pick up on the nuances of the culture, how people dress, how they act in meetings, how they speak, etc., and do your best to acclimate. Another small tactical tip – consulting operates around the clock, but other companies may operate differently, so be mindful. If it’s not a norm to send an email on the weekend, hold it until the Monday. Don’t overwhelm people with the style and pace that you’re used to working in consulting. Observe and adapt!</p>\n<p><em>What is it about your current role that excites you the most? How has it been different both working on the consulting side for Ross and now at Ross?</em></p>\n<p>Everything! It is really fun to be part of a growth company, and in a sector that is so exhilarating. Working at a company, as opposed to consulting for a company, certainly makes you feel more like part of that story, and your investment into the success of the company is on a different level. Of course, you want your clients to be successful – it reflects well on you and it brings back more business – but when you work internally you feel an even stronger sense of ownership.</p>\n<p>The Strategy role inside an organization is really dynamic – there is just so much more breadth and depth to the work. In consulting, you can end up doing a lot of similar types of projects, but once you’re in an internal strategy role, you get pulled into things across all functions, and that’s really stimulating. Getting so much exposure to all facets of the company, while at the same time building deep knowledge on each topic, really rounds you out in terms of ability to take on more senior leadership roles as you progress in your career.</p>\n<p><em>Now that you have been at Ross for over a year and a half, what advantages do you think off-price retail offers folks who are thinking about careers in retail?</em></p>\n<p>Off-price is hands-down the most interesting sector in retail right now. At business school, I remember people were coming to talk to me about how to get into luxury retail, and I would laugh because there is just so much more growth, excitement, and financial upside with the value players. I think it’s important to focus on what excites you – but if you really love retail, then it should extend beyond the smoke and mirrors of a sexy brand or attractive employee discount.</p>\n<p>If you are passionate and experienced in retail, and then have a chance to learn the ins and outs of the off-price model, it is fascinating. Though all retailers like to claim “we’re different” in most cases, they’re not. Retail is retail. But that’s not true in off-price. The off-price game is different. It’s fast paced, dynamic and requires incredible discipline. When I look at the off-price merchant, it is a more unpredictable and demanding job than the typical merchant. It’s definitely harder yet at the same time, if done correctly, is so rewarding.</p>\n<p><em>Raines has done a lot of work with your team over the past few years and brought in great talent from the top firms. How can someone stand out in their interview with Ross? What qualities are you looking for in candidates that will lead them to be successful at Ross?</em></p>\n<p>At Ross, smart and competent is a given. Beyond that, we want to hire relatable people who will be able to adapt to the organization, be willing to roll up their sleeves, and build strong relationships within the company. The people who say, “I’m almost Partner, and so I’m looking for an SVP role reporting to the CEO,” are the people who will not be the right fit for our team. We also look for people who have taken an interest in Ross and gotten to know us. They’ve done their research, visited a store, and gathered as much information as they can. They come in understanding our model and with a strategic perspective on some of our strategies (e.g., why we don’t have e-commerce). Even if a person isn’t a retail expert, they can still do all of the above and have insightful views about what we’re building.</p>\n<p>Our job as strategy executives is to help drive the company to success and partner with the CEO on initiatives that are going to move the needle for our business. Many times those projects involve shifting core processes or fundamental behaviors of the organization. We need people who are willing to get very operational and tactical, have a desire to train and coach, and then deliver new ways of working to a huge organization. People who view strategy as an ivory tower that only interacts with the CEO will not be successful at Ross.</p>\n<p><em>How can someone assess a corporate strategy role as a stepping stone to a senior functional or GM leadership position?</em></p>\n<p>A strategy role at a company that understands how to leverage strategy is a great bridge between consulting and industry. Given my experience on the inside, I think it’s hard for consultants to jump into a functional role from consulting and be as successful, or feel as rewarded, in a short time frame. In a strategy role, you get to see all aspects of the organization and work side by side with members of the functional teams to really learn their problems and opportunities. By the time you take on a functional role, you’re more informed. It gives you a greater platform for success and it is well-respected by the organization. I think 80% of our strategy team comes here with the hopes of moving into a functional role, and there are plenty of opportunities to do so.</p>\n<p>At the same time, don’t sell short the role of strategy itself. When I think about my path forward, I feel it will be hard to go narrower and focus on one thing. I get to work on such a breadth of topics across all different functions. So, I think that people who loved the diversity of new projects in consulting will find strategy to be a great place to build a career that will set them up for success in many executive leadership roles down the line.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Position: Digital Acceleration Officer</p>\n<p>Current Firm: Group SEB</p>\n<p><em class=\"profile-intro\">Can you tell us a bit about your early career at Peugeot and then what led you to Bain?</em></p>\n<p>Peugeot was very interesting for me in terms of international experience. I was learning about an entirely new continent, and there was a totally different level of economic development in Indonesia and Malaysia. I quickly realized, however, that I still needed the basic management skills and the fundamentals of how to do business in a more standard environment. Bain was already an option because I had done an internship there, and it was the whole combination of it being a great place to learn all the basics, a very dynamic culture, certainly prestigious and well paid, and the open exposure to different geographies and industries. I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do in my life but knew that consulting would be a good training ground.</p>\n<p><em>You worked out of Bain’s New York, LA, Paris, and London offices – how did this additional level of variety contribute to your growth, and did it hurt in any way?</em></p>\n<p>Great question. It certainly hurts if you’re aiming for Partnership, because at a point — probably when you reach the Manager level — if you’re serious about making it to Partner you’ll want to capitalize on your network locally. But if you’re actually thinking of your career more broadly, I think it helps, because bringing geographic diversity to your curriculum is now a must-have for any kind of C-level executive position. There are more and more positions now, especially at the GM level, for which experience on at least two, if not three, continents, is required. And just Europe and the US are almost not good enough now. You need to have Europe, the US, and probably Asia or Africa to be relevant.</p>\n<p><em>You left Bain to pursue your MBA full-time, then went back — how did your career objectives evolve throughout your consulting career, pre- and post-MBA?</em></p>\n<p>Bain has fantastically structured their program so that you are indeed learning a new skill set each time you progress levels: from Analyst to Consultant, from Consultant to Case Team Leader, from Case Team Leader to Manager, and all the way up. You start with the basic analytics, then you go into collaboration, then team management, and you end up in commercial skills with your clients. You are always learning something new. So that was the evolution for me. Then, when I got to Senior Manager/Principal at Bain, I realized that I had reached a little bit of a plateau in terms of actual new learning. And frankly, I lost the passion. I felt like a project was a project was a project, and I really started wondering “OK, how can I actually get a little bit more excited about going to work every morning?”</p>\n<p><em>And then the PepsiCo opportunity came along at a great time for you. What was your thought process in evaluating opportunities throughout your consulting career?</em></p>\n<p>I only entered the recruiting process once or twice in those eight or nine years. Once was with Raines on PepsiCo when I was a Case Team Leader, but I quickly stopped that one, if I remember well because I realized that actually getting to Manager at Bain was quite a big deal. And then, I was invited to second round interviews at a top PE firm, but I politely declined because in the process I realized how crazy that lifestyle was. So, for eight years, the story was basically “you know what? Even though I have some bad days in consulting, it’s still a pretty good deal, and the grass is not going to be much greener elsewhere.” And then all of a sudden, I got into my ninth or so year, and things got a little boring at Bain. The pipeline to Partner was getting a little bit stuffed and it was going to take me longer than expected. I certainly got a little bit demotivated and demoralized by the idea of having to wait a little longer to be a Partner. That’s when PepsiCo came across again, and the opportunity to really get into an organization and report straight to the CEO at a $70B company. That sounded pretty challenging — definitely some learning to be had there.</p>\n<p><em>Was it important to you to enter a large corporate strategy team at a top consumer company?</em></p>\n<p>The more important thing was to enter a company that had a track record in taking their strategy people to operational jobs, and especially to General Manager jobs. That was my bias.</p>\n<p><em>It sounds like you were pretty grounded in recognizing that the grass is not always greener, and really evaluating your current circumstances. How would you coach someone facing similar career decisions now?</em></p>\n<p>I think it’s really crucial to take a big step back and consider whether you are truly designed to be a lifetime consultant. Do you really have that crazy analytical horsepower that’s going to make you smarter than many execs in a room? Do you really have a passion for analytics? Do you really have a passion for telling a story in a pithy, compelling way; for convincing CEOs, etc.? If you do, good for you! You’re probably one of the 10% of people who have been through consulting who should probably stay for a long time. But, if you don’t, don’t feel bad about it. It’s not a big deal that you’re not one of the few superstars at McKinsey, Bain, or wherever. You might be a thousand times happier in a different job. I noticed in my time in consulting that so many people desperately try to stay and get to the next level, despite the feedback that they’re not actually fit for the job. So I think you really need to take a step back.</p>\n<p><em>What do you think really opened the PepsiCo doors for you and got you hired as Senior Director of Strategy out of Bain?</em></p>\n<p>I think it was the specialization in CPG at Bain. Too many consultants have that really broad, generalist career path. And that’s where you need to walk the line carefully between massaging the data and being honest and truthful. If you’re applying to a really heavy industry job and you send a generalist consulting profile or a profile that is focused on banking, you’re never going to make it. You need to customize your resume to really bring out what’s relevant. Companies are crazily risk-averse, so people are always looking for a copycat. They want the guy who has already done it elsewhere and will do it at their company. So, the implication for a consultant is that if they really have no background in that industry or in that function, it’s not going to happen.</p>\n<p>And then, when it comes to interviewing, the tips are really quite simple and straightforward, but obviously, you need to show a passion for the company. For that, my background in CPG certainly helped, but you also have to talk to people. You can’t just read the website or the annual report — you need to show a certain level of understanding of the company from within, that only personal discussions with people who work there or have worked there will do. That is a super important thing.</p>\n<p><em>When transitioning into industry after many years of consulting, what are the challenges and the differences encountered?</em></p>\n<p>As a consultant, you may be tricked into believing that you know how to make things happen and that you understand an organization. It’s not true. You’re still an outsider. You still don’t understand the weight and importance of the people aspects, of the organizational aspects, versus analytics.</p>\n<p>I must say, for at least a year, I really wasn’t sure that I had made the right choice. Transitioning into corporate strategy in a big group like that is very, very tough. All of a sudden you really run into all the politics which you never fully understood as a consultant. And you don’t necessarily have the same kind of resources, same large teams, to really do all the analyses etc. Beyond that, you often don’t have the same clarity in what you need to deliver, because you’re actually juggling with a few bosses who obviously have different agendas. For a year or so, for me, there was some doubt.</p>\n<p>But then, things got much more exciting. I really started working in Digital at PepsiCo. I started having a bit of a vision into the next job, and I realized that I was really going to transition into something like a General Management role. So eventually it made sense and I was reassured that I didn’t do all this for nothing.</p>\n<p><em>What strengths did you come in with and immediately utilize?</em></p>\n<p>Consulting is a fantastic school for communication. Everything you learn from a top consulting firm, like pyramid principle and storytelling; clear and structured communication; the ability to really deal with complex analytics and frame a complex issue; those are key.</p>\n<p>Many consultants have unrealistic or misguided expectations regarding what their first-year responsibilities in industry will look like, as well as their path to their ultimate goal. What was your career progression at PepsiCo like, and how did it align with what you had envisioned or planned when you exited consulting?</p>\n<p>When you enter an organization in industry, you have to make a lot of slides and edit a lot of typos and you become a little bit of a monkey for the CEO. You were used to having a great team doing all of the tough work for you and now you’re doing a lot of it yourself. That’s what happened to me when I moved to corporate strategy and I think it happens to many people. It’s similar to the shock felt when you get out of a prestigious MBA and then go to a top consulting firm, and you’re actually cranking out data on Excel when you thought you were going to be a CEO or something. The kind of Harvard cliché. When you transition, you must be ready to roll up your sleeves and prove yourself.</p>\n<p><em>After corporate strategy, why did you choose to go into digital, and did you make any sacrifices by doing so?</em></p>\n<p>I didn’t really make any sacrifices. Digital was definitely a personal passion first. I’ve always been interested in the new geeky kind of stuff and tech innovation. That kind of stuff has always been a passion and a curiosity of mine. Then, where the lightbulb went on for me, was when I realized the kind of tailwind that digital came with. It’s so important to find a topic that really has a tailwind. To me, that should be one of the top criteria in screening for a job.</p>\n<p><em>You were in great standing with PepsiCo when you left, you presumably could have progressed well there, and multiple other companies were actively pursuing you and extended you offers for significant leadership positions. Why did you choose Groupe SEB?</em></p>\n<p>With Groupe SEB it was really the breadth of the role. It was a global role, and for me, it was absolutely key to keep that international perspective. And it was digital in the broad sense — not just e-commerce, but actually bringing together all of digital and really transforming the company along those lines. And then the second factor was the total, absolute, genuine conviction that the executive committee had, that digital was a top priority. That really is a key decision factor. At a certain point, you’ve got to check and double check — both in the interviews and ideally through connections — what it is a true priority for the executive committee and the board that you’re going to be leading. External sources are always better on those kinds of pressure-testing, but still, when you interview, you can check that you’re hearing the same messages; that everyone says things like “yes, digital is one of the three priorities for our company today” and “yes, the level of resourcing is going to be X,” that kind of stuff. You need to ask very specific questions and be satisfied with the answers.</p>\n<p><em>Are there any key moments or decisions throughout your career, which, in retrospect, you would identify as having had a very heavy impact in getting you where you are today?</em></p>\n<p>Yes, of course. Right now, I’m having so much fun in the job. I never dreamed I would be so happy in my job. I work a whole lot more than in consulting, by the way, but I don’t care because frankly, I get up every morning without an alarm clock because I just can’t wait to see what’s in my inbox.</p>\n<p>Declaring digital as a passion of mine when I came to PepsiCo was huge. I mentioned it to the CEO when I started and that led to a couple of things. I never realized that three or four years down the road, it would have gotten me to where I am now. That’s one moment. Then the other moment is just leaving consulting to take that leap of faith that I could actually be a GM one day.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<div class=\"profile-intro\">\n<p>Position: Chief Operating Officer</p>\n<p>Current Firm: Hickory Farms, Inc.</p>\n<p>* At the time of this interview Matt was the Senior Vice President, Operations and Merchandising at Redbox.</p>\n<p><em>You graduated from Northwestern University with a degree in Economics in 2001 and joined Marakon Associates during an unfortunate moment for the economy. What led you to Marakon? How did you succeed despite the condition of the consulting industry and business world during this time?</em></p>\n<p>That was definitely a bit of a crazy time, but I didn’t know it was going to be crazy while I was in the recruiting process in the fall of 2000. The industry got very volatile in the summer of 2001 – lots of firms (including the big ones) deferred and rescinded offers. Ironically, I had offers from large firms and one in particular put the hard sell that based on their scale, they had more stability… and then later that summer, they rescinded the offers of my classmates.</p>\n<p>I was attracted to Marakon because of the people and the culture. It was a small firm that did pure strategy work; that meant they were a little bit more isolated from the downturn – with a small number of strong client relationships. The work was focused on major strategic decisions with CEO-led projects for big companies, which was exciting. I also had strong connections with the people that I met through recruiting. Even through the interview process I identified potential mentors, and I was excited about working with that team. And in terms of culture, the company consisted of very driven people, but it was still a very collaborative culture. I also liked the smaller size of the company (about 250 people when I joined), which meant each office was relatively small and I was afforded lots of opportunities, even at a junior level.</p>\n<p><em>And clearly you did really well with the firm, having remained at Marakon for five years. When you joined did you anticipate staying for so long?</em></p>\n<p>I honestly had no clue. I had a fairly typical perspective coming out of my undergraduate program. I thought that consulting would be a great place to learn what “business” really is and to learn foundational skills, get exposure to different industries and then figure out what it was that I wanted to do. I really loved my experience at the firm though. I was fortunate to have multiple opportunities to work internationally, including about six months in Europe, seven months in Asia and several trips to South America in addition to projects across the United States. It was a great learning opportunity; I was exposed to new cultures, new problems and new industries. I enjoyed it and kept going for five years.</p>\n<p><em>After almost hitting the five-year mark, what went into your decision to leave the firm? Why did you choose to enter business school at the time that you did?</em></p>\n<p>I was at the point where momentum was starting to set in, and I asked myself, “Do I really want to do this forever?” I was still enjoying the consulting experience at the time, but it felt like the right time to take a break and go to business school and maybe try some other things out, explore some other opportunities, just to test myself and figure out if consulting was where I wanted to be for the long-term. Plus after five years and all that work and travel, I was ready for a bit of a break.</p>\n<p><em>Is that part of the reason why you chose to complete your MBA internship at Danaher versus at another management consulting firm?</em></p>\n<p>I entered business school with a few explicit ideas that I wanted to test. Private Equity was very popular for ex-bankers and ex-consultants, and I wanted to explore that industry and learn what it was all about. General Management was something that I was attracted to as well&#8230; the idea of running something and being responsible for a P&amp;L. I had no intention of doing a summer internship in consulting – I knew what the consulting job looked like and what it had to offer. To me, the benefit of doing that two-year MBA program is having that summer to explore something and test something out. I spent most of my first year fall quarter focused on building a perspective on the Private Equity industry and the job market there – and whether my skill set was a good match and whether it interested me. I talked to all of my classmates who had either come out of Private Equity or were also interested in going into Private Equity. I think I talked or emailed with virtually all of the Kellogg Alumni in Private Equity at the time. That (Kellogg alumni network) is a really precious resource, and the alumni were incredibly responsive. Those conversations helped me understand what PE jobs actually looked like, whether the skill set I was bringing from consulting translated well and if I would be interested.</p>\n<p><em>And what was your conclusion?</em></p>\n<p>I decided I wasn’t excited about it! I had a strong finance background from my time at Marakon, but I didn’t get excited about the finance mechanics and the deal economics. I was a lot more excited about solving problems within companies and trying to make them more valuable. PE firms were definitely talking about that, but they weren’t always doing a lot of it. It was also clear that most PE jobs were going to individuals with PE experience before business school.</p>\n<p><em>So what was your next move?</em></p>\n<p>During the winter quarter and internship recruiting I switched my focus to the General Management side. Danaher was a company I had known about for a long time. I helped research and write various white papers at Marakon which looked at the most successful companies from a total shareholder return perspective and Danaher was always at the top of the list (even though most people have never heard of them). At the time they were a $10 billion or $12 billion company and they operated about 150 P&amp;Ls of different sizes. Their recruiting pitch was, “Come here, learn our way, and in three years we will give you a $15 million P&amp;L to run. If you screw it up then it won’t really matter to us because it is a tiny part of our overall business, but if you do it well, then we will give you a $30 million P&amp;L to run, then a $100 million P&amp;L.” That really resonated with me as a great approach to talent development and a great opportunity for me to learn what it takes to run a business. Danaher was my top target from an internship perspective and then it is what I ended up getting through the interview process. It was a pretty unique opportunity to get into a company like that.</p>\n<p><em>Yet despite your good run with Danaher and the anti-consulting mentality you had when entering business school, you went back into management consulting. Was there ever a point where you thought you were going to stay in the corporate world? At what point did you decide that you wanted to give consulting another go?</em></p>\n<p>It was a somewhat last minute decision, to be honest. I had the option to go back to Marakon since the beginning of business school, but I had been focused on other opportunities. I was very interested in Danaher even after the internship and this is where some of the logistical challenges of business school and big company internships come into play. I interned in a very small business unit, about a $30 million dollar business in the suburbs of Chicago. I had a great experience and did great work, but that business did not have any full-time positions to hire for. I did have the offer to go to Danaher, but I had to then find a different business which had a need for full-time hires, and at the time, most of their opportunities were in North Carolina, Colorado, and Washington. I worked to create an opportunity in one of their Chicago business units because my wife and I were set on staying in Chicago at the time, but the timing just wasn’t right. I ended up thanking them for the offer but told them I couldn&#8217;t move at the time.</p>\n<p><em>And that’s when consulting came back into the picture?</em></p>\n<p>At that point I decided that I would still learn some things if I went back into consulting – specifically, I wanted to diversify the types of problems that I had exposure to, and I wanted to get an increase in leadership responsibility, leading bigger teams, and engaging with more senior clients. I considered returning to Marakon, but ultimately I decided to join Bain &amp; Company. While I was in business school, Marakon went through some questionable moves and there were several leadership transitions. It was not the same firm as when I left. One of the Senior Partners from Marakon that I had worked with a lot had joined Bain. At that point, I was debating just going back to Marakon or not when he called me and said, “Matt, you need to come to Bain. You’ll be great and you’ll love it.” I decided to check it out.</p>\n<p><em>You joined Bain during the height of the 2008 global financial crisis and recession. While it appears that you have a penchant for joining companies during a recession, how was your transition back into consulting?</em></p>\n<p>I definitely didn’t win on timing the market, but I learned early in my career at Marakon that you have to take a long-term view of things because in the short-term it can look pretty volatile. Culturally, there was a lot of similarity between Marakon and Bain; the transition was smooth. But the project work was really different. Some of the difference was definitely due to the economy in 2008 and 2009. Some of the projects I worked on probably weren’t core Bain projects, but I did end up working on a lot of post-merger integration projects and that’s definitely a Bain core competency. It’s really critical work, but it’s not the most satisfying for me. In a lot of cases, it becomes much more project management than strategy and problem solving – other than at the outset and at the most senior levels.</p>\n<p>Even if the work wasn’t exactly what I was most excited by, it was a good experience. The post-merger integration and cost-cutting projects were good exposure to that type of business challenges and solving different problems from what I had done in my prior consulting life. The other thing that I was looking to get out of by going back into consulting was more senior-level management experience from the sort of influence I would have, from the client-side and from leading bigger teams, and I was able to get that at Bain.</p>\n<p><em>While they weren’t the types of projects you had anticipated working on once at Bain, how did those earlier opportunities help you down the line and in shaping your consulting career the second time around?</em></p>\n<p>My time at Bain did provide me the leadership opportunity I was looking for – in terms of managing bigger teams, managing multiple workstreams, and engaging with more senior clients directly. While the PMI work isn’t as intellectually stimulating from a problem-solving point of view, it is fantastic from a client engagement perspective. Even at the more junior levels of the consulting team, these projects are typically high-client facing roles and require a ton of leadership. You become the right-hand person to the functional leaders of the organization, helping those leaders to make the most important decisions about how to organize their teams for success.</p>\n<p><em>Speaking of not wanting to do it anymore, from a timeline perspective you were only five months shy of Manager when you left Bain in March 2011. Were you up for Manager? What drove your decision to leave the firm despite the potential promotion?</em></p>\n<p>I was coming right up to the promotion window at Bain for Manager. It wasn’t clear that I would have made the promotion at that point, though, and I was also starting to doubt whether I wanted the promotion. The Manager promotion window at Bain is a really significant threshold, which isn’t necessarily true at the other firms which break up the post-MBA roles a little differently, and push that major decision point out a couple of years. Bain also has a one-year commitment with promotions, which not all consulting firms do, so I started asking myself, “Do I really want to be a Manager? Do I want to do this for another year or more?” I had done enough self-reflection to know that I did not want to keep pursuing the path to partner; therefore the question I wrestled with was, “if I don’t want to be a Partner, then what’s the added value I’ll get from being a Manager?” Depending on the path that you’re looking to follow, sometimes having that promotion point and doing the manager job for a year or two can open up more opportunities, but not always. I knew that I did not want to go into a corporate strategy role in a big (Fortune 500) company, and I had the confidence that if I was pursuing opportunities at smaller firms, the resume boost of the promotion might not be as critical.</p>\n<p><em>Once you made that decision, how did the opportunity at Redbox come about? What went into your decision to pursue that particular opportunity, company, and industry?</em></p>\n<p>I knew of Redbox, but it wasn’t explicitly on my target list. When I left Bain, I spent time relaxing reflecting about what roles excited me. I settled on a relatively simple focus: roles where I could apply the problem-solving, data-driven, analytical mindset I had gained from consulting to work on important/impactful problems, and where I could see results from the work relatively quickly.</p>\n<p>I still had that General Management mindset and desire to ultimately be a GM and run a P&amp;L, and I focused on looking at roles that had at least some operational/execution responsibility and ideally with some options down the road to transition. Lots of companies hire consultants in strategy roles, and many of those companies will talk about moving people from strategy roles to line/functional roles, but I focused on trying to find real examples of that, not just talk.</p>\n<p>These ideas about the role didn’t come to me overnight, but rather crystalized over a period of a couple of months through conversations with friends and mentors in my network. I found that it was really helpful to talk through these ideas with people, and also to solicit ideas from my network on other people that I should be talking to.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, it was my Kellogg network that brought me to Redbox. A good friend who knew what I was looking for had seen a job description at Redbox and passed it in my direction. I took a look, and it was very close to what I was looking for. The company was hiring for someone to lead a team to solve really complicated problems, and the team was a group of talented, driven, individual contributors. Most of the team had a professional services background, and the culture matched – very career-driven, self-motivated individuals, who wanted challenging work and actively sought out a lot of feedback to keep developing. The team was relatively small, but it was clear that it was very well-regarded within the organization. To me, this sounded great. So I threw my resume in and the interview process kicked off.</p>\n<p><em>Once you joined the company, were there any surprises or challenges in your transition from consulting to corporate? How did you address them?</em></p>\n<p>I had a really good view of what I was getting into so there weren’t too many curveballs thrown my way. During the recruiting process, I interviewed with my boss, my boss’s boss, and several other leaders across the organization, but I also interviewed with all of the analysts on the team whom would later manage. At first, I thought this was bizarre, but it was actually amazing because I came out of the interview process already knowing all the people that were going to be on the team; I already had some perspective on their backgrounds, what they were excited about, and the problems they were tackling. It got me really energized to join the team.</p>\n<p>The consulting skill set also made that transition a lot easier because consultants are used to ramping up on a new industry and a new client and working with new teammates because you do it all the time. Coming out of consulting made the transition easier because it was just like starting a new project, where you have to figure out really quickly the people, the industry context, the business context and prioritize how you are going to add value, how you are going to get some wins on the board right away.</p>\n<p><em>Do you have any advice on how people can onboard based on your own experiences? How did you go about hitting the ground running and adding value immediately?</em></p>\n<p>I think there are a few key components. You have to leverage the role of being new by being curious. During my time at Marakon, we had this saying, “Challenge with empathy.” That is how we viewed our role with clients. You want to be challenging people; you want to ask tough questions, but you have to do it with empathy, not as a know-it-all. I think that is definitely a useful perspective for onboarding. When you are new to a team or a company, you have to take full advantage of the first month or two when you get to ask basic questions because you are new, where you get to challenge the status quo because it’s not thought of as being attacking&#8230; you are just trying to understand things. When you do that I think you can really quickly identify opportunities to make changes that are going to help the business and help the team. Then very quickly you can be seen as someone who gets things done and makes things better. Some of that is cliché, but I think being curious and not being afraid to ask questions and figuring out where you can make a difference quickly all help from an onboarding perspective. After that, you just need to make sure you have really clear expectations with your boss on whether or not you are working on the right things and to establish explicit goals you need to reach in a 30-60-90-day kind of timeframe so that you don’t miss something.</p>\n<p><em>At what point did you start shaping your career toward operations and merchandising? Was this a path you started cultivating for yourself before joining Redbox?</em></p>\n<p>I knew that I wanted to move out of strategy and into more functional leadership and ultimately General Management responsibility. I didn’t necessarily know which path that would take until I got to Redbox. In the group I joined at Redbox, I was responsible for strategic initiatives and major problems. Several of those problems were directly related to our merchandising – how we optimize our inventory and what we stock in every kiosk. I really threw myself into that work, and that created an opportunity relatively quickly for me to take over the team that led the execution of all of our merchandising processes, as well as the analysts who were working on projects to try and optimize those processes. That meant not just solving problems, but also being responsible for execution every day and having really tangible metrics to tell us how we were doing.</p>\n<p>Redbox is a retailer at its core, and the operations are our key to success and key to maintaining our value proposition, which has meant there’s never been a shortage of questions to tackle in the operations space. I sought out those problems whenever it made sense, and that created some natural opportunities to expand my responsibilities and to start touching other pieces of our operations that are less about the strategy and science and a lot more about moving things around.</p>\n<p>After leading our Strategy &amp; Analytics team for about two years, I transitioned into leading our Inventory and Logistics function. That was a shift to 100% execution and continuous improvement.</p>\n<p><em>In only four years, you have gone from working as a Case Team Leader at Bain to managing multiple departments and over 1400 employees in a two billion dollar division of a multi-billion dollar public company. What is your recipe for success?</em></p>\n<p>It’s all about focusing on results and trying to push yourself and your team outside of the comfort zone. I get excited about building teams and leading those teams to solve really big problems. Most of my success can be traced to building great teams and setting them up for success to solve those problems. That means a commitment to attracting, retaining, and developing talent, and it means ensuring that the team is structured and positioned effectively to tackle those problems. And lastly, it means identifying and prioritizing the problems that really create value for the organization.</p>\n<p>There is some mutual reinforcement there, though, because great talent is attracted to other great talent and to a place where they can have a real impact. I see my role as creating the environment for that to happen.</p>\n<p>I also recommend trying to maintain that pace where your teams are just a little uncomfortable – asking them to do just a little bit more. For me, that means seeking out work and issues across the organization and signing my team up to be responsible where I know they will make an impact.</p>\n<p><em>Over your last three years with the company, you have done a lot to develop and improve the customer experience. On the flip-side, what has the company done to develop you? What about working at a company like Redbox has added to the skills toolbox you acquired during your time with Marakon and Bain?</em></p>\n<p>The first obvious one is the jump to being on the client-side and now being responsible for results. It’s not just about coming up with the idea anymore; you&#8217;re actually in charge of implementing it. Execution becomes critical. The processes you need to drive consistent execution across an organization, especially one the size of Redbox, become critical. When you are in a consulting environment you can just throw more hours or people at a problem. If we had a really challenging case at Bain we would go to staffing and say, “Hey we need another AC to come help us out and to crunch some numbers.” That was okay there, but in the corporate world I have a team of 1,400 people right now and more human resources won’t necessarily be the answer. Being able to be smart and create processes that scale is really important. Then there is the people leadership. In consulting, good people leadership is critical, but there are fewer variables than in the corporate world. The talent in consulting firms is much less diverse in terms of educational background and career stage. And the industry is built on the up-or-out system, which means there is a clear career path for everyone who joins a consulting firm. It’s transparent, and you know where you are. In the corporate world, those career paths are not always defined or transparent. And the talent is much more diverse in terms of career stage and background. That diversity is great for team performance, but it introduces more complexity in talent management and people leadership.</p>\n<p><em>Now heading out on a new path as SVP, what do you see for yourself in this new role and how do you think you are managing towards that path? Where do you see the industry going in the coming years and how are you preparing for that within your new role?</em></p>\n<p>We have been really successful at Redbox, and a lot of that success is driven by the execution of our Operations team, and I am very excited to lead this team. It is a very passionate and very entrepreneurial team. One of my priorities is making sure that we maintain that passion and entrepreneurial spirit. Because of our scale and breadth of the network we have some unique challenges that not a lot of other retailers have, which is exciting. It will require some really creative solutions to generate the results we need for future success.</p>\n<p>I am focused on driving engagement with that really large team because we need them as we continue to evolve. Redbox is the value leader for new release movies at just $1.50 a night, and my job is to make sure that we continue driving efficiency within our supply chain network and operations so that we can stay the valued option for consumers. Something I learned really early on at Marakon is that consistency is the most important aspect of any strategy. You can’t be the low-cost provider if you don’t have the lowest cost operating structure.</p>\n<p>In some ways, the challenge now is harder than it has ever been. We have already taken a lot of low-hanging fruit already, which means now we need to get a little more creative with how we continue to evolve over the next several years, especially knowing that our overall market is evolving very rapidly.</p>\n</div>\n",

      "content": "<hr />\n<p>Former Partners from McKinsey, BCG, and A.T. Kearney reveal why they waited to leave consulting.</p>\n<p><b>1. I liked the work, the colleagues, and the clients.</b></p>\n<p>Dave Rickard<b> </b>spent sixteen years at BCG, including nine as Partner. He left to join Uline as Vice President of Continuous Improvement. Dave says, “When I joined out of business school I thought I would stay two to five years&#8230; I think it was a combination of interesting work, the colleagues that I got to work with, and then ultimately developing relationships with some of my clients that kept it very interesting and appealing, so I stayed a lot longer than I initially expected.” As Dave developed relationships with his clients, he wanted to continue to see them succeed. “I wanted to stay with them through the course of their own business cycle.&#8221;</p>\n<p><b>2. Few other opportunities were as compelling.</b></p>\n<p>Usman Rabbani worked at McKinsey for eight years, leaving at the Partner level to join KKR Capstone as Director, Technology Operating Lead. An expert in technology, Usman frequently received calls from recruiters. “I used to seriously consider one or two opportunities every year, and I think that’s a healthy habit for people in management consulting,” he says. “But I never found a mix of things that was as compelling as what McKinsey had to offer, until Raines International called about the role at KKR.” At that time, Usman had written a plan to stay at McKinsey for the rest of his career. “I felt that there were very few things that could be as compelling as what I had. KKR happened to be one of them.”</p>\n<p><b>3. There was more to learn.</b></p>\n<p>Gil Krakowsky joined A.T. Kearney with the intent to exit into industry a couple of years later. He ended up leaving seven years later as Partner, and now serves as Executive Director of Global Strategy at Gap, Inc. “The pace of my career path kept me in the game. There was always the promise of another level of seniority, another bump in compensation, and another set of challenges… I felt like I had entrepreneurial control of what I wanted to do, and I felt like I was learning a lot.”<b> </b></p>\n<p><b>4. Tenure in consulting matters.</b></p>\n<p>Delaney Steele joined BCG right out of undergrad and stayed there for thirteen years, leaving as a Partner. Now, as SVP of Strategy &amp; Marketing at Ross Stores, Inc., Delaney has built out the company’s Strategy team. From a hiring perspective, tenure in consulting matters. <b>“</b>The number of years someone spent in consulting can be very influential. There is a difference between a Junior Principal and a Senior Principal in terms of the number of years of experience they’ve had presenting and facilitating conversations with senior leaders.”</p>\n<p>These former Partners remained engaged in consulting because of interesting work, smart colleagues, and client relationships. And, importantly, they made a choice not to leave consulting until they found an opportunity that would be at least as compelling as their current role.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<p class=\"profile-intro\">Position: Vice President, Revenue Management</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">Current Firm: Waste Management</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>By 2006, you were already well on your way toward being a senior executive in a Fortune 500 company. Why did you go to business school when you did, and what was your plan at the time?</em></p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">There were a couple of reasons. The most important was that I wanted to broaden my horizons, as corny as that sounds. I felt like I had gone as far as I could reasonably go in a limited amount of time at HP. HP was enormous, and I felt like to take it to the next level I needed to broaden myself. I thought that an MBA, specifically from a reputable school, would be a good way to do that.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">Another reason is that years prior I had thought about going into consulting. I put in a preliminary introductory call to one of the bigwigs at McKinsey in the Pricing practice to ask about the hiring process. He advised me at the time that it was very tough to enter McKinsey as an experienced hire without a graduate degree of some sort. So that also spurred me on.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>After earning your MBA, you joined McKinsey’s Atlanta office as an Associate. Were you considering any other career options post-business school?</em></p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">The short answer is “no.” I had my sights set on consulting because I thought it would be fun to go into a space where I could be exposed to a lot of different industries. I wasn’t convinced that consulting would be the end game for me, but I knew I wanted to see something other than Compaq and HP. Consulting was the primary avenue I set my sights on.</p>\n<p><em>What was it like for you to transition from corporate into consulting at that stage in your career? What skills did you need to learn as you went along?</em></p>\n<p>I came in as an Expert in the Pricing practice. Money was reasonably attractive, but it was definitely a step-down year one &#8211; probably a 15-20% pay cut. I went in assuming that I would learn a lot, which I did. But the first six months were absolutely miserable. I was one of the 3% of McKinsey employees who are experienced hires, and I did not enjoy it all. McKinsey has a very specific way of structuring and breaking down problems, creating slide decks, communicating, et cetera – as do all consultancies. As a relatively old dog compared to people who came in at the start of their careers, I had to unlearn and relearn an awful lot of things that I had not focused on historically. The learning curve was incredibly steep, and I wasn’t sure I was going to make it after a couple of months. I stuck it out, and ultimately I think joining the firm was the best decision I ever made career wise.</p>\n<p><em>You mentioned that the first six months were really difficult – what changed after that?</em></p>\n<p>I think it was just a matter of getting into the groove and understanding the basics of how McKinsey approaches problem-solving, putting together decks, et cetera. I thought I would automatically get a ton of credit for the ten years of pricing experience I brought to the firm, but I quickly realized that what I knew paled in comparison to what McKinsey knew about pricing. So all this value that I thought I was bringing to the table was close to zero. I was basically starting from the ground floor – and I think it was that realization that made it intimidating. But once I learned the basics, it became an incredibly enjoyable and enriching experience.</p>\n<p><em>You spent 5 years at McKinsey and left as an Associate Partner and Pricing Expert. Was there an Expert Partner level? Was that something that was on your radar? How long had you initially planned to stay in consulting?</em></p>\n<p>McKinsey has an Expert Partner track. I probably could’ve stuck it out for another year or two and achieved that. But at the time, on the Marketing and Sales side &#8211; and Pricing is part of Marketing and Sales – McKinsey hadn’t quite figured out the Expert Partner track. I was getting a lot of conflicting advice about what I needed to do to make it to the next level. What I had really enjoyed in my five years at McKinsey was being able to spread myself across a ton of different clients. I had a very varied book of clients, which was fascinating. I worked in technology, media, industrials, data, airlines, hotels – and I loved that. That’s what drew me to being a functional expert &#8211; the variety of clients. So when I was being given advice in some quarters that “You need to think about more of a generalist path or find a couple of core client situations that you can make your permanent home,” I felt that was at odds with what I wanted to do. I wasn’t sure I would be massively successful on a long-term basis if I stuck it out because becoming more of a generalist was something I was ultimately less excited about.</p>\n<p><em>What was it like to join McKinsey in the Expert track?</em></p>\n<p>So there were two Expert tracks. You can come in as an experienced hire and choose either the Partner or non-Partner track. The non-Partner track caps your total compensation, but you are not required to travel as much and you are not expected to do as much in the way of business development. You are expected to be a known brand within the firm to solve specific functional problems. If you choose the Partner track, which I did, you travel pretty much like a generalist Partner, and you are expected to do business development and initiate some of those opportunities. That was the path I chose because I felt that if I was going to stick it out in consulting, I wanted to not be capped from an earnings perspective, and I wanted to ultimately get to the Partner or even Director level. That was my original intent when I joined.</p>\n<p><em>You mentioned the variety of industries you worked in at McKinsey. What was it like to work in so many different industries, after having spent several years focused on one industry?</em></p>\n<p>That was one of the best parts of McKinsey: getting that exposure, seeing a variety of companies and management styles, and seeing such an array of products and services. It was the coolest thing about my experience there, next to learning to solve problems and communicate and all those soft skills McKinsey taught me. You look at all these blue chip names out there and you assume that these companies have their act together. They do to a degree, but there is opportunity to improve everywhere. I now walk into a situation with the mindset that it doesn’t matter how strong the brand is or how well the stock is doing, there is going to be material opportunity to do things better. Consulting bolstered my point of view in that regard.</p>\n<p><em>When Raines International called to tell you about the VP, Pricing role at Waste Management, </em>were<em> you already considering leaving consulting? What other opportunities did you consider, and what was so appealing about this one in particular?</em></p>\n<p>I had been thinking about leaving, but I had not explored anything definitively. I talked to my wife about doing something else, and the primary reason was that the work-life balance wasn’t doing me any favors. I had two young kids and I was traveling like crazy. Another executive search firm had called me about Waste Management. I turned them down twice because I was totally unexcited about the prospect of going to a waste company. It wasn’t until Raines International called and convinced me to listen to the pitch, and talked about how pricing is top of the agenda for the CEO, that it started to pique my interest.</p>\n<p><em>Is it unusual for pricing to be a top priority for a CEO? How much exposure do you get to executive leadership?</em></p>\n<p>I would say it is unusual. Everyone told me pricing was top of the CEO’s agenda at Waste Management, and I wasn’t sure whether to believe that until the interview process culminated in the CEO interviewing me and reinforcing that. I had never heard of that before. There are many companies where pricing is close to the top of the agenda, but not all the way at the very top. We are a price-driven company. We talk about it all the time. When we do our earnings releases on a quarterly basis and speak with analysts, price always comes up. I’ve had a material amount of senior leadership exposure. I’m now reporting into the COO, and I meet with the CEO regularly to talk about results. We had an investor meeting a couple of months ago where eight of our largest investors were pulled in – it was organized by one of the industry analysts. I was one of three Vice Presidents to be asked to speak about strategy in a given area, and of course, that was pricing. It is unusual for that to be the top of the agenda, but it really is in this space, which makes it exciting.</p>\n<p><em>In what ways has your consulting experience impacted the way you approach your current role? Is there anything you know now that you wish you could share with your pre-consulting self?</em></p>\n<p>The best decision I ever made was to join McKinsey, and the other best decision I ever made was to go back into industry. McKinsey armed me with a fast and data-based way of looking at problems. Being hypothesis-driven is probably one of the biggest strengths that McKinsey has conditioned me to be. Breaking down and structuring a problem, being able to size it, being able to effectively communicate a solution to a given problem &#8211; those are skills and abilities that I undoubtedly learned at McKinsey. I thought I did a pretty good job at those sorts of things before McKinsey, but I know now with hindsight that I was nowhere near as capable on that front as I am now. The McKinsey experience was hugely valuable and prepared me for this role better than anything else I had done.</p>\n<p><em>You mentioned you report to the COO &#8211; has that always been the case, or has your role evolved over time? What did you deliver in your role that led to the increased responsibility?</em></p>\n<p>I started out reporting to the Chief Marketing &amp; Sales Officer, who reported to the COO. There was a restructuring last year, he ultimately left the company, and my position was morphed. I started as the Vice President of Price Management, and now I’m the Vice President of Revenue Management. That basically means that I get to do all the cool stuff in pricing, but also spend a third or more of my time figuring out how to increase volume, too. Historically, we have not been as successful at moving the needle on volume as we have on price. I had a conversation with the CEO late last year before the reorganization, where he asked me what I wanted to do next, and I said, “I’ve proven that I can help you move the needle on price. I think I can help you move the needle on volume, too, and I would love to do that.” So Revenue Management was born out of that conversation, at least in part, and we married price and volume together so that I now work hand-in-hand with the sales force to figure out where there are volume opportunities to further bottom-line improvement.</p>\n<p><em>How has pricing changed at Waste Management since you joined?</em></p>\n<p>Bottom line impact from pricing was at a low from 2010-12, with 2012 shaping up to be the worst year on file when I joined. I did not know this when I interviewed, and neither did Waste Management – they were attempting to manage to an imperfect set of metrics. We pulled a bunch of levers in 2012 which paved the way for a solid 2013, but ultimately it was not enough to save the day in 2012. That was the first year in a long time that WM did not pay out bonuses. It was also my first year there, which marked a concerning start for me from a take-home pay perspective. So my first year saw me essentially take a pay cut due to lack of bonus.</p>\n<p>The fruit of our labor paid off in 2013, and it turned out to be our best pricing year ever, only to be bested by 2014. In fact, the average impact from pricing was up $160 million dollars a year 2013-15 vs. 2010-12. That’s nearly half a billion dollars in incremental impact above and beyond what we achieved the three years prior. Our investors appreciated the focus, as reflected in our share price ascending from $33 at the beginning of 2012 to a high of $55 in April of this year.</p>\n<p>This was enabled, really, through a focus on performance management, including accountability, transparency, setting targets, and building tools. We had a lot of talented people, but a lack of common themes and clear responsibilities was clouding accountability for results. So I reorganized my own team to drive improved accountability. As far as transparency, we completely overhauled metrics and reporting. We started publishing exhaustive and comprehensive standardized pricing dashboards and reports to our 17 Area teams and to senior management. We set targets based on new and improved metrics, and we reported against these targets monthly. The management team tied compensation/bonus to achievement of these targets. Finally, we built and continue to build, tools and decision-support models that inject more “science” into pricing. I can’t share much of this, but suffice to say it’s a very, very big focus. And the cool thing about pricing is that the return on price-related investments is typically very big. As McKinsey taught me, no financial lever impacts the bottom line like price.</p>\n<p><em>Taking a step back to the beginning of your career, what initially drew you into pricing? And after almost 20 years in pricing, albeit in a variety of environments, what has kept you so committed to the function?</em></p>\n<p>My second job was with Compaq in Europe. I was on a SAP project, which is obviously very technical. I had responsibility for a number of functional elements, including the pricing functionality of the order management modules. How’s that for technical? So I went around Europe gathering requirements for how pricing in the order management environment should work. As I went to Europe and spoke to people across various European, Middle Eastern, and African countries, I realized that the really cool thing about pricing is that it touches a little bit of everything. It touches sales, marketing, finance, logistics &#8211; you name it. That means you get exposure to a lot of different functions and people. And I loved that. I loved that it permeated everything we did. To me, that was exciting. Later on, as I got involved in McKinsey and I realized that I had only just scratched the surface of what you can accomplish with price, I drank the Kool-Aid that says that there is no lever that a company can pull that can have more impact dollar-for-dollar than price, and that sealed the deal for me.</p>\n<p><em>How has the pricing function changed in these years?</em></p>\n<p>I remember sitting in on these pricing lectures fifteen years ago, where they said the function was growing and evolving, and that eventually companies would hire positions like Chief Pricing Officers. I remember at the time thinking, “That sounds like a pipe dream and I don&#8217;t see that happening.” But the function has absolutely been elevated to the top of management teams’ agendas, and Waste Management is a great example of that. When I joined Compaq in 1996, pricing was a stepping stone to the fun jobs in marketing. It was the first job you might get if you joined marketing, and really all you had to do was manage a spreadsheet and update a couple of numbers. If you did that well, you might get to do something cool like marketing communications or product management. But it was an entry-level position, and nobody ever stayed there for longer than they had to. It has completely evolved away from that, and now the amount of thinking and analytics and cross-functional relationships that it requires has tended to attract a higher-caliber individual. The profession as a whole is being elevated on a pretty consistent basis, and we are now seeing VPs and SVPs of Pricing &#8211; I still haven’t seen Chief Pricing Officer as a title, but the profession as a whole is being elevated, and in my biased way I think very rightly so.</p>\n<p><em>Given that elevated status, would you recommend pricing as a transition role for consultants going into industry?</em></p>\n<p>I would. Ideally, you have to have some pricing experience to go into pricing, so if you’re contemplating leaving consulting, pricing is certainly worth looking at if you gravitate toward that sort of a field. I will say that it’s a field that is pretty young. By that I mean there isn’t nearly as much in the way of intense competition for the top jobs in pricing as there would be, I imagine, in the strategy or private equity world. Given that it is a profession that is developing, given that more and more senior positions are cropping up, and given that there isn’t a huge base of candidates &#8211; at least that I know of &#8211; who could truly say they are experts in pricing, it’s certainly not the worst of career options to veer into. I love it. My wife says I’m the happiest she has seen me in a long time. That has a lot to do with the topic and a lot to do with the company as well.</p>\n",

      "content": "<div class=\"profile-intro\">Position: Senior Director, Logistics Strategy</div>\n<div class=\"profile-intro\"></div>\n<div class=\"profile-intro\">Current Firm: The Gap, Inc.</div>\n<div class=\"profile-intro\"></div>\n<p><em>What led you to work at a trade association after your undergraduate degree?</em></p>\n<p>I completed my undergraduate at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public Policy and International Affairs at Princeton University. I was very interested in the problem-solving aspect of policy and developing policy changes that would generate the most value. I primarily focused on international trade, and after school I took a job at the American International Automobile Dealers Association, which represents import car dealers. They were looking for someone who could do analysis to support lobbying relating to trade, which seemed like a great fit for me. After a little bit of time and through several years working in Washington D.C., it became obvious that D.C. is more about politics than policy, and I was far more interested in the latter. That is what led me toward business school.</p>\n<p><em>Was business school part of your script? Did you already know that you would eventually go?</em></p>\n<p>Not at all. During the years between college and business school, I explored my other passions, such as history. I explored the option of getting a Ph.D. in History, and I explored some different types of professional schools, such as law school, where I could focus on international trade. I went through the matrix of what was of interest to me and figuring out what I would actually do in the job and how I felt about what I would be doing in the job. For example, that 2-by-2 for being a history professor was that I was very passionate about the topic, but the day-to-day job of writing and doing research and being beholden to ivory tower politics was not interesting to me. I wasn’t exactly sure what the topical piece would be for life after business school, but the day-to-day problem-solving and making real, fast impact based on a career in business was a life that interested me.</p>\n<p><em>You must have been aware of management consulting to some extent during your undergrad at Princeton, yet you didn’t go to business school with the goal of going into consulting… that just happened?</em></p>\n<p>During that time I was in exploratory mode and was highly cognizant of the fact that I had a non-traditional background coming into business school. Given my background in automotive, I thought that I would enter that industry afterward. I went on the job for a day at one of the leading auto-manufacturers and found it distressing how little interest most of the employees seemed to find in their day-to-day work. Most people were only excited to work at that company because it was local. I wanted to enter an environment where people were passionate about the work they were doing and about the impact they were having, as well as build up my skill base in the business world. After that revelation, I figured there was no better place to get that skillset, exposure, and experience than in management consulting.</p>\n<p><em>So you did a summer with Boston Consulting Group and you were smitten?</em></p>\n<p>Yes, I worked at BCG for a summer in Los Angeles and I had a wonderful time. Going into it, do you really understand the value of what you are going to learn in consulting? Not at all. You come to understand that after the fact. After summer you can better realize and understand the tangible nature of the things you are going to learn and start to see that road before you.</p>\n<p><em>Once you joined BCG, did you put a plan in place where you were ultimately working toward Partner? Or did you think that you would leave after two years?</em></p>\n<p>At that time, I thought I would get the skills and then boogie on out of there. I definitely was not looking to stay and make Partner. At the end of the day, though, I didn’t know how long it would take for me to get the skills I was looking for and figure out what the next &#8216;next’ would be. That was a journey.</p>\n<p><em>As far as picking a practice, did you do the generalist thing for a couple of years and then find your way or were you particularly excited about one industry over another?</em></p>\n<p>I actually benefited from the fact that I transferred offices after my summer in L.A. and started full-time in New York. Part of that process at BCG is a little bit of a ‘dating’ period. They want to meet you and want to make sure they want to accept the transfer. Part of that process is having you pick a practice where you would like to talk to someone in the functional area and the industry area.</p>\n<p>My industry pick was Consumer Goods and I was introduced to the lead of the CPG practice in New York. My bigger love was &#8211; and is &#8211; in operations, specifically manufacturing and supply chain, which was a passion I discovered during business school. I met one of my favorite people at BCG, who now leads the East Coast system for BCG. He was the Operations Leader for New York City and led the relationship with a major pharma client. I didn’t have a specific interest in that industry, but when he gave me a call about six months into my time in New York and told me he was about to kick-off a big project there and wanted me to join the manufacturing team, I jumped on it. This was my first project within operations at BCG. It didn’t matter that it wasn’t CPG. I knew that working with him and his team would be a phenomenal experience and that working with the company would be not only interesting, but I would learn a tremendous amount. It was such an engaging experience, I ended up staying with that client for 3 years.</p>\n<p><em>How did your pre-MBA experience help you during your first few projects and during your transition? What was your transition like in terms of completing the work and hitting the ground running?</em></p>\n<p>I think the bigger impact of my pre-MBA experience was actually the confidence I had to hit the ground running and to add value to these projects. Initially, I thought that I would be behind my colleagues given my non-traditional background before business school. It took a while for me to realize that my curiosity, work ethic, and what I bring to the table were just as sufficient as what everyone else had to offer and that my experiences would help make me a very strong consultant. I thought I was behind, but in practice, I wasn’t. Did people look at my resume when they were trying to staff me and wonder how in the world they were going to staff someone whose background was in public policy? Absolutely. So there was a hill to climb from a perception standpoint. Once you execute well, however, you start to climb pretty far up that mountain. Once I worked on a key client and had very extensive client-building projects and excel-modeling projects all in one, it dispelled many of those concerns for me and for others who were trying to figure out how to deploy me onto projects.</p>\n<p><em>What kept you at BCG for five years and did you ever come close to leaving before you ultimately went to Gap?</em></p>\n<p>I spent three years in the New York City office and I spent almost all of that time with the same client. During that time, I stayed at BCG predominately because of the work I was doing and the team with whom I was working at BCG and the client company. I had a very unusual experience in that I was part of an ongoing strategy function supporting the company. I was not doing purely project-based work. Even at my level, I would get pulled into the day-to-day operations of the manufacturing business, budget, capital, and other ad-hoc projects. I felt that I was growing considerably even within and in part because of the stability of that world. I moved to San Francisco for personal reasons and decided to stay at BCG for the next couple of years because I really liked what I was doing at BCG and I was enjoying the experience of being a Project Leader. Part of the reason I chose to stay was because it became very clear to me that there was a lot of value and a lot of learning to be done as a Project Leader. While I was consistently evaluating whether I should stay or go, I determined that I wanted that training and experience under my belt. It was the right decision to get that experience. There is so much you are learning and you grow so much during that period. As five years at BCG went by, I decided to move on within San Francisco because I found that I was missing the environment that I had enjoyed while serving the long-term pharma client. I missed solving not only project-based problems, but the day-to-day problems of a manufacturing, supply chain, and logistics organization. I was very fortunate that Gap, which is local, had a Supply Chain Strategy team, which was exactly what I wanted to do.</p>\n<p><em>What were some of the experiences and development opportunities that made you happy that you stayed as long as you did at BCG versus leaving after two or three years?</em></p>\n<p>The number one skill I gained was the aptitude and ability to frame a big problem, both from a storyline perspective and from an analytical perspective. It is a very different ballgame to structure your own module and analysis versus structuring an entire ten, sixteen, or twenty-week effort. That is not a skill you develop overnight. Part of developing that skill is trying to not find it extremely daunting. You need to be comfortable wrapping your arms around a big problem rather than staring at a twenty-four-week tunnel and not being sure how to cope with that. The other piece I gained was the skill of managing others and learning how to create an environment within which people want to work for you, like working for you, grow working for you, while still ensuring that the work gets done in a timely, high-quality manner. That balance is difficult to obtain.</p>\n<p><em>After five years at BCG, you were about two years away from making Partner. Was any part of your departure difficult because of what you felt you were giving up or was it easy to step away from that potential opportunity?</em></p>\n<p>At that point, it was not difficult for me to step away from the opportunity of making Partner. I think that if I were still in New York it would have been a more difficult decision.</p>\n<p><em>You mentioned that you were fortunate that Gap had a local Supply Chain Strategy team. What did you think about Gap as a company considering your interests in manufacturing, and how did you come across the opportunity there?</em></p>\n<p>The way that I structured my job search was that I wanted to work in supply chain, manufacturing, and operations. In the end, I was not going to compromise on that because I knew how much of my personal satisfaction within my job was tied to content. It was also very important for me to work in an environment that was challenging, high-caliber, and where the people were nice to work with. Not much to ask! Lastly, I wanted to work in an industry that I was personally passionate about: I didn’t have that connection with Pharma. This made my recruiting process more difficult, as I was knowingly veering away from a whole set of experiences and contacts that I had built over the last five years. I did so willingly, however, because I wanted to set myself up for a career that I was excited about. I found my current role and team by virtue of my current boss being ex-BCG and posting about the job on the BCG Alumni Network. Leverage the network!</p>\n<p><em>Did you use transition time with BCG or did you look for opportunities outside the company while working full-time?</em></p>\n<p>I used transition time, absolutely. I highly recommend it.</p>\n<p>Have you ever found yourself at Gap tackling problems the same way you would have at the pharma company you supported for so long? How transferrable has your experience in a Pharma company been in a completely different industry?</p>\n<p>I find that my experiences at the pharma client have helped me tremendously in understanding a corporate environment and adjusting well to it. Some people have difficulty leaving consulting and moving into corporate. It can be jarring. After feeling like an internal at another company after working with them for so many years, the transition, fortunately, wasn’t jarring. When it comes to trying to apply the way of life at a Pharma company to the way of life at Gap, I see that folks at Gap display a high degree of curiosity about benchmarking and how you define ‘best in class,’ which a company like the one I worked for does plenty of and they are always thinking about how to become world-class in X, Y, Z. Folks have been very curious about those experiences and perspectives I gained at a pharma company. In terms of trying to apply specific lessons, I don’t think I have that tendency of going about my projects at Gap in that way. I think that when I first got here I was trying to figure out how I could apply certain strategic lenses from a pharma-type or CPG-type world to the Retail world, which didn’t always work; a certain SKU in retail has a four week life-cycle, where a product at a pharma company has a seven year life-cycle. For a little bit, I had to grapple with the fact that this is a different industry and the value that I would add here was how I thought about things, not the specific ‘what.’</p>\n<p><em>Now that you know the lay of the land, what are some of the possible paths you see for yourself, and how are you managing toward that path?</em></p>\n<p>I believe at this point that my path in the future is to be in a role similar to the current Head of Global Supply Chain &amp; Product Operations function. If not at Gap, then a role like that at another company. The role is one that oversees not only our sourcing and manufacturing operations but also logistics. And then there is also a product operations component. In a way, it is similar to a COO-type role with specific supply chain expertise. And what is perhaps unique about landing in that type of role versus saying that you want to be the head of manufacturing or the head of logistics is that, at least in a company like Gap, I would need to orchestrate a career path that 1) is not purely strategy, 2) is not simply deep in one functional area and 3) needs to have experience and respect for brands and business units. If that is my ultimate path I cannot simply stay within the confines of supply chain forever in order to make it to that top job. So landing in a logistics strategy role would be the first of multiple moves I would anticipate, whether that is within Gap, Inc. or outside Gap, Inc., in order to gain that functional experience and expertise across multiple areas, not just an in-depth knowledge of supply chain and/or logistics.</p>\n<p><em>If you think about the group of people at the same Principal level that you were when leaving consulting, often they tell us that they only want to be an SVP of Strategy, a President, or a General Manager, and they set these super lofty goals for themselves and they measure every opportunity against those usually unattainable goals. Could you give us insight into why it was so smart for you to join a Fortune 500 company at the Director-level even though the role wasn’t one level away from the CEO?</em></p>\n<p>Especially because I was switching industry focuses, I was aware of the fact that I had a lot to learn about not only the apparel retail industry but how Gap, Inc. operates. I had not done consulting for Gap, Inc. and every company is its own ecosystem. Supply chain, supply chain-oriented roles, and strategy roles are very broad and you need to understand how the business works. It ended up being a great stepping stone, to come into a company in a perhaps more humble position because it gave me the runway to learn, and expectations were such that I had that runway at a Director-level versus if I were entering as a General Manager or in a more senior position.</p>\n<p><em>Entering a new company and industry, switching from consulting to corporate—you anticipated that there would be a learning curve and some surprises. What have been some of the surprises for you since going internal? Were there any misperceptions that you had about life on the inside that has proven wrong?</em></p>\n<p>When you grow up in a top consulting environment you are surrounded by extremely talented thinkers and Type-A personalities who will work 100-hour weeks. You perceive that environment as being the top talent pool to be surrounded by in any field. But I have found Gap to be filled with extremely motivated, intelligent, top-of-their-field professionals and it is an amazing group of people to be surrounded by. I feel like I am not an outlier in terms of what I am bringing to the table. I am amongst folks who are equally motivated and passionate about the business.</p>\n<p><em>Any tips for how people can onboard based on your own experiences?</em></p>\n<p>There is this saying used at Gap, “go slow to go fast.” You need to take the time to learn. In consulting you are encouraged to hit the ground running and you only have a certain amount of time with any given project if you are, say, at the Project Leader or Principal level and you yourself are not developing longer term relationships and you need to start making an impact right away. In corporate, I think it is more important when you are coming in to have a more balanced perspective, especially if you have not worked in the company or industry before. You need to take the time to listen and get to know the people around you, how the business works, how people operate with each other. Yes, you need to be showing up in the right way and providing value, but to come in and think that it’s about putting out all this new work and making a huge impact on Day 2 can backfire. Take the time to understand the lay of the land and how you may best add value and achieve what you want to get out of the role professionally.</p>\n<p><em>Was the transition easy for you, or was there anywhere you think you got it wrong?</em></p>\n<p>I wouldn’t say it was “hard,” but there was still plenty I had to adjust to. I didn’t have a team &#8211; I was an individual contributor to start off with, which in one sense was hard because I was now left doing all of the work that I used to only do a part of. But the flip side was that this gave me the time to understand Gap. I just had to learn how to direct myself versus directing others. After that, it was a process of really navigating different areas that needed support and starting to slowly build the relationships that would enable people to understand the value that I and ultimately my team could bring, but also that they trusted our capabilities and insights despite the fact that I was new to Gap and apparel retail. I built a new strategy team with primarily former consultants and when building that team from scratch with people who were from the outside and new to Gap, I had to assure my colleagues that I had a team of smart, quick learners, who were committed to collaborating with the people who are already experts.</p>\n<p><em>What have been the highlights for you since leaving BCG, both personal and professional?</em></p>\n<p>The highlights are certainly building and maintaining my own team. I like helping others develop and watching them grow, whereas at BCG you may only have people on your team for a short amount of time. Now I get to see folks grow over a longer period of time. Another highlight is feeling like I am building a really rich expertise, both in logistics and apparel retail, whereas before I had focused primarily on pharmaceuticals. I like being a knowledge expert while also being able to apply industry knowledge from different areas to what I am doing today. Lastly, a big highlight is being able to see the impact of the strategy that we have developed over the past eighteen months. We are really moving forward and changing the apparel supply chain, and charting a course that will enable us to be a leader in retail fulfillment. That is very exciting to be a part of.</p>\n<p><em>Do you have any regrets about leaving BCG? Is there anything that you miss?</em></p>\n<p>I miss my frequent flyer miles! No, most of all, I miss the people. There were a lot of friends I made over five years, and I miss the environment. There is a buzz about BCG. You see new people come through and there is an excitement of the new classes, in part because a lot of people are there to build skills and go off and do other exciting things. That generates this sense of urgency among the talent.</p>\n<p><em>How has the work-life balance been for you?</em></p>\n<p>We work pretty hard at Gap and supply chain, especially as we are going through a transformation. Since I’m in a new role and building out a team, there’s a lot to do. It’s a really exciting time to be at Gap.</p>\n",

      "short_URL": "http://wp.me/p7C5yw-2dP",
      "content": "<p>Position: Co-founder</p>\n<p>Current Firm: Rocketmiles, Priceline Group</p>\n<p><em class=\"profile-intro\">You spent three years at BCG pre-MBA, and then another four years at the firm, leaving as a Principal to join Motorola as the Director of New Multimedia Products. Were you looking to leave consulting at the time? What other opportunities had you considered, and what set this apart?</em></p>\n<p>I felt in my gut that I didn’t want to be a consultant for the rest of my life. I wanted to work in a company that was growing quickly or aspired to grow quickly, and I wanted to not have a strategy job.</p>\n<p>I had a perspective that if you are going to do strategy-oriented work, it’s probably better to work at McKinsey or BCG or Bain than to do it on an internal basis at a company itself, because you tend to not be able to take many risks in your recommendations, and sometimes the projects aren’t as interesting.</p>\n<p>My goal was to be able to build a little bit of operating experience as a result of leaving, and I wanted to work at a company that was growing. I figured that this was an investment in the long term, so it wasn’t a matter of getting the perfect job or getting the perfect salary – or even the perfect company. It had a lot more to do with working in a growth industry and being able to diversify some of the experience that I had gotten at BCG.</p>\n<p><em>After Motorola, you spent over three years with United Airlines as Managing Director, Mileage Plus. Clearly, the role influenced your career going forward (we’ll talk about that later), but how did you become interested in the travel industry?</em></p>\n<p>I’ve always been interested in travel. I think many people would probably say the same thing. I’ve done a lot of travel in my life. I had gotten exposure to some of the loyalty programs – frequent flyer programs and hotel programs – as a result of traveling for BCG, so I was really curious about the psychology of how those loyalty programs worked and why people make different purchasing decisions. So it felt like a pretty good move to go in that direction.</p>\n<p>I was particularly interested in United at the time because they were evaluating spinning Mileage Plus off into a separate business altogether, and I thought that was an opportunity to be part of what could have been an iconic shift in the company. When a big change like that is coming up, it’s helpful to have people who have very versatile skills, so I probably got a little bit more responsibility as a result of going to United, and I had a nice P&amp;L responsibility there.</p>\n<p><em>How did that opportunity come about?</em></p>\n<p>It’s a little bit crazy – I was interested in working in experience design and product design, and the job I had at Motorola was basically to do the assortment planning and figure out which phones Motorola should be building in the future, and I wanted to continue in that vein. I was introduced to a woman who had recently joined United from Disney, and she was responsible for improving the customer experience at United. She told me there was an acute need at Mileage Plus and introduced me to some of the folks there, and I thought it would be an exciting, higher risk, higher return opportunity.</p>\n<p>When I left United, I had been there for three years and had some commercial success. The scope of my responsibilities had changed a fair bit, and I felt like we had done a good job of building out an effective team. Those things were quite different from the experience I would have gotten at BCG. I felt I had put points on the board for United as well as for myself, and I was looking at the upcoming years and thinking that they might not be as exciting as my first three years. This is partially because I tend to get a little restless in general, but also because United had merged with Continental. When two big companies merge together, there are a lot of career opportunities, but a lot of it has to do with politics and cost-cutting and process-oriented things. I’ve always been interested in building new businesses or launching new products, and when you’re merging two companies you just don’t have the capacity to do those types of things.</p>\n<p><em>You left United Airlines to join Groupon as Vice President and General Manager of New Business, where you stayed for a little over a year. What did you learn from that role?</em></p>\n<p>I had a great experience. Groupon was still pre-IPO when I joined. Obviously, the company has invited a lot of scrutiny and opinions. One thing that is independent of any of those opinions is that they built a company extremely quickly, and they were in the market for people who could build additional businesses. That felt like a pretty good match for what I was doing. I think that if I had been invited to go work at Groupon in a Sales position or with the daily deals business, it wouldn’t have been as attractive. But the role that I was invited to do there was to basically use the existing platform to go out and build new businesses. I felt it was worthwhile to get some credibility at an e-commerce company, and a company that aspired to grow by 50% every year instead of by 5% every year. I thought that even in the worst case scenario, I would be practicing a new sport altogether and I would learn something as a consequence of being there.</p>\n<p>It worked out really well in that regard, and I had the chance to help build two new businesses from scratch in a year and a half. I think that if I had launched Rocketmiles – my current business – right after BCG or right after I left United, it wouldn’t have been successful. Part of the success that we’ve had is a function of my understanding what a fast pace really feels like, and also interacting with a different set of people than you tend to find in a consulting firm or in a gigantic corporation. I know how to do some big company stuff, but I’ve also had the chance to work with people who have started things from scratch – which is a different skill set altogether.</p>\n<p><em>As you mentioned, you left Groupon in 2012 and cofounded Rocketmiles, a startup travel rewards program that was acquired by the Priceline Group in February of this year. In a 2013 interview with “Inside Flyer,” you said that Rocketmiles was, in some ways, an idea you had been thinking about your whole life. How did you know it was the right time to leave and fully commit to Rocketmiles?</em></p>\n<p>You never really know for sure. It’s kind of a matter of a feeling more than anything else. I had gotten some stuff done at Groupon that I was proud of having accomplished. I felt like if I was ever going to do it, then this was the right opportunity to do it. I had the right combination of a good idea and a good team. I decided I was going to budget a year to give this a go, and the worst case scenario would be that I would have an interesting life experience. The best case scenario would be that I would build a successful company and a good experience for my team.</p>\n<p><em>In the first year, what were the biggest lessons, and what pitfalls did you experience?</em></p>\n<p>First, I think you need to be a little bit irrational to be an entrepreneur. The numbers suggest that you are going to fail, and if you’re in your mid-30s and you’ve got a decent-paying job, it’s not a rational economic decision to be an entrepreneur. If you don’t realize that, you’re bound to be disappointed. I’m also a bit idealistic. I’m sure every entrepreneur thinks that their idea is brilliant enough that it’s practically going to sell itself, and everybody’s going to find it, and you probably won’t have to do any marketing at all. That’s not the case. I think we’ve got a really good product that is relevant for a lot of people. I feel proud whenever anyone makes a booking with us. But there’s a ton of work that you have to do to engender trust in your customers, and that just takes hard work. I think we had a good idea, but the marketing aspect is hard work.</p>\n<p>Another thing is that the ups and downs associated with being an entrepreneur are much more severe than any other job I’ve had. Working at BCG is a hard job, and I worked hard at Motorola and United, but it pales in comparison to the ups and downs that you experience when you’re starting something from scratch. We had a couple of days two months after launch where we put up goose eggs and nobody made a booking on Rocketmiles. We sat there wanting to call our friends or our moms to make a booking just so that we didn’t have a goose egg. It was just heartbreaking to have those days. But as a result, you appreciate when things go better.</p>\n<p>There’s something different about starting something from scratch. I had noticed it at Groupon with Andrew Mason, the founder. I think that there was a little bit of a caste system for people who were there in the beginning versus those of us who came later on. There is a different level of bond and a different level of empathy that goes along with what I just described: experiencing the days, two months after launch, when nobody made a booking on the site. That makes you humble and gives you a kind of empathy for what other entrepreneurs are going through.</p>\n<p><em>In a 2014 interview with “Bootstrapping in America,” you said your strategy from a team perspective has been to hire the best folks. And you have mentioned before that it’s important to find ways to work with people who have different/better talents than your own. How did you select your team?</em></p>\n<p>I think it was important to have some shared values, like the way you want to treat other people and whether you’re building a system of intrinsic motivation or extrinsic – financial – motivation. You need to make sure everyone has a common definition of success.</p>\n<p>The second important thing was having people with different capabilities and different strengths than the ones that I had. I knew the travel arena well and had some relationships in that area. I was pretty good on the airline side of things and had some product muscle memory. But I had never built anything from scratch. My two co-founders had a little bit of travel experience, but they had experience starting companies from scratch. It’s just a different set of skills. One of the two co-founders, the Chief Technical Officer, was the best developer I had ever worked with. We had all worked together at Groupon and had gotten to know one another there, and had been through some good times and some tribulations there, so I think we had a pretty good sense for our working styles. Picking who you are going to work with is an awfully important decision.</p>\n<p>And after that, in contrast to what big companies and consulting firms do, I really buy into the idea of inviting people to start doing the job before you hire them. You can do that in an interview process, or you can do that by inviting someone to be a contractor. I feel like you learn a lot more about somebody that way, in terms of both skills and effort level. So to fill out the rest of the team, for example, we had a designer who did some part-time work who is now our Head of Product. We had a guy who was writing some copy for us who now runs all of our Customer Experience team. In each of those cases, we had a chance to get to know them well on a rent-to-own basis. It worked out well. I think they would say the same thing – they had a chance to see what the work was like and what the culture was like.</p>\n<p><em>Your team is spread out over several cities – how does that impact the culture of the firm?</em></p>\n<p>My two co-founders are in different cities. If we had never worked together before, that would have been a very big detriment. But the fact that we had worked together before made it work. In the early days, I was spending quite a bit of time with them building the product, so I would travel to San Francisco or they would come to Chicago. I thought to have A-players was more important than having everybody in one building. That has made it hard from time to time, but overall it has worked.</p>\n<p>The Priceline Group says it prefers its acquired companies (which also include OpenTable, Booking.com, and Kayak) to continue to function as independent entities. With that in mind, have there been any significant changes in the way Rocketmiles operates?</p>\n<p>Priceline has a philosophy on this because they have been extremely successful with previous acquisitions. Their blueprint is to keep the companies really independent, and their belief is that you get a lot more out of the autonomy and the entrepreneurial spirit than you get out of the synergies of the companies working together. There are a few things around the edges – for example, we’ll get some hotel supply from Priceline Group – but other than that, we act completely independently. And I think that’s a good thing for the team.</p>\n<p><em>Is there anything you wish you had known prior to the acquisition?</em></p>\n<p>I think some of the fun of it is that you don’t know and that you have to make decisions rapidly. You have to give yourself a chance to fail and to fail five times before getting it right. The biggest thing that I learned that I would carry forward to whatever I do next would be around pace, and getting stuff out as quickly as we possibly can. We’ve hired a couple of consultants recently, and it’s fun to coach them to do less in PowerPoint. We should be pushing things out and testing them, rather than spending a lot of time thinking about them or doing surveys. In this world – a scrappy, ultra-competitive startup environment – getting stuff out there is always a better solution than spending a whole bunch of time thinking about it and making sure that you’re covered if things go wrong. We might be able to get six things done this month, and maybe none of them will work, but it’s better to know that now than to sit on it for two or three months, which is what tends to happen in larger companies.</p>\n<p><em>What advice would you give to current Principals who want your job someday? How long should they stay in consulting? Is there anything you wish you had known back then?</em></p>\n<p>I think consulting is really good as a way to build an analytical toolkit and communication skills. I think that the quality of the people you work with – both the raw intellectual horsepower and, in many ways, the creativity – is unsurpassed. But if you want to do something yourself and get your hands dirty, the very best thing you can do, in my opinion, is to find somebody five to ten years ahead of you, who maybe spent a year or two in consulting, and find a way to work with them. Soak it up for a year, and figure out whether you like the entrepreneurial environment. Put yourself in a challenging environment, independent of compensation or title, and just find people that you’d be interested in learning from, who will be hard on you and help you make the transition from trading in intelligence and communication to actually getting things done. The best advice, put simply, would be to reach out to the alumni network and find people who have gone out and done interesting things post-consulting. Find someone who is five to ten years ahead of you and tell them that you’ll do whatever they want you to do as long as it has real accountability.</p>\n<p><em>Of all of your professional experience, what experience was most instrumental to your success at Rocketmiles?</em></p>\n<p>I take something from all the experiences that I had. I do still think of my formative years at BCG as being an era that I was really proud of. If it’s a matter of setting a high bar and a definition of what good work is – that’s BCG. If it’s a matter of speed, I would say that I learned that at Groupon. It’s really hard for me to say that one of them was the most instrumental. They all served a different purpose, and they each represent a different phase of my life, so it’s hard to choose just one.</p>\n",

      "content": "<div class=\"profile-intro\">\n<p>Position: SVP, Head of Strategy and Innovation</p>\n<p>Current Firm: Capital Group</p>\n<p>* At the time of this interview Heather was the SVP, Client Experience at Charles Schwab.</p>\n<p><em>Your career seems broken into two distinct periods &#8211; life pre-BCG and life post-BCG. How did you make your way from an academic background with a huge focus on child care and child development into consulting?</em></p>\n<p>I know they can appear disconnected, but there is a common theme. I think the common theme is that I have been passionate about having impact, broadly speaking, and wanting to do meaningful work that is going to have an impact. Early on in my career, that was in the form of Mayor Bloomberg’s office in New York City, and UNICEF. In the course of the public sector work I was doing, I saw the strong voice that the private sector had in many decisions that were being made. That was a world I hadn’t been exposed to, so I wanted to get exposure and learn as much as I could. Of course, since joining BCG in ’06 – and more recently – my career has definitely gone in the direction of the private sector, but I remain passionate about social impact in my personal life. In fact, that commitment to social impact is part of what drew me to BCG and Schwab – both firms have philanthropic endeavors and make material investments in the communities they work in. To answer your question more specifically, I made my way into consulting essentially as an opportunity to climb a very steep learning curve and get a ton of actual work experience along the way.</p>\n<p><em>When did consulting hit your radar?</em></p>\n<p>Actually, it’s funny. It hit my radar during the second year of my PhD. As you probably know, these degrees can take four to six years to complete. BCG may not have realized that at the time, because they said, “We are doing a summer internship. You’ll intern with us, and we’ll hire you if all goes well.” So I did the internship. It was a race to the finish after that, and I joined the firm two-and-a-half years later. It was a mini-internship in New York that they did for folks in non-traditional backgrounds for consulting: PhDs, MDs, JDs. It was really an incredible and eye-opening experience.</p>\n<p><em>What was it like for you to transition from academic work to consulting work, with decks and client presentations and the skill set required to be successful as a consultant?</em></p>\n<p>To be honest, I found my groove by putting in a lot of hard work and long hours. The workload in the first couple of years was tough, and I saw it as an initial investment on my part. During that period of time I was very deliberate in trying to identify peers, Partners, and Principals that I respected and had a lot to learn from. I sought out their knowledge and their advice and I listened really carefully. I emulated them as much as possible. I really took advantage of the feedback culture at BCG, because I realized that was really the only way I was going to learn: to get out of my comfort zone, to get feedback, and to try it again. It was tough, but I made some great friends along the way and had fun.</p>\n<p><em>A number of PhDs go into consulting for only a </em>year,<em> and then leave. Was that ever something that you considered?</em></p>\n<p>When I took the job at BCG I had just gotten married, I had just moved to New York, and I had seen a lot of people do exactly what you said: Spend one or two year in consulting, and then leave. I realized BCG was a big risk. I didn’t know if it was going to work out, and when I joined I insisted to my husband that we actually not spend any of the signing bonus, just in case it didn’t work out and we needed to give it back. Literally. I was a little naïve! He came from consulting and tried to convince me it didn’t work that way. So, I think leaving after a year or two was a possibility, but I was also very stubborn and I saw it as an opportunity. BCG was something I was going to jump into with both feet. I remember the head PhD recruiting for the Americas sat us down and explained, “If nothing else, this is a really steep curve that’s going to feel very uncomfortable, but you are never going to have the opportunity to learn like this again, so take advantage of it.” That message resonated with me and that is how I thought about every project I did at BCG and every role I’ve taken since leaving the firm.</p>\n<p><em>And you enjoyed it?</em></p>\n<p>Absolutely. I loved it. I could definitely see myself going back at some point down the road, assuming they wanted me back! After a while, though, it started to feel comfortable and got to the point where I wanted a different learning curve and to be part of a different kind of team. The opportunity at Schwab materialized and I made the jump.</p>\n<p><em>Within consulting, how did you make your way into the Financial Services Practice?</em></p>\n<p>By accident! I went to BCG believing that I would focus on consumer goods. I had the Ph.D. in Psychology and a background in Statistics, and I had experience with a lot of the analytics the Consumer team at BCG was doing. That was probably the most immediately applicable part of graduate school at BCG. But the staffing coordinator in New York City reminded me that I told her I had joined the firm to climb this learning curve. So, she encouraged me – strongly – to try out a few other areas of the business. I’m only half kidding when I say the most redeeming factor of the Financial Services case I found was that it was three weeks long.</p>\n<p>Joking aside, I looked at the list of projects and literally walked around the floor asking my friends which teams were really phenomenal to be on – again because I always saw this as an apprenticeship business. Through that, I ended up working with a really phenomenal team. I went into the project believing I would do it for three weeks and then I could bounce back to my consumer work. But I really enjoyed working with this set of folks. In a lot of respects, the biggest “break” I ever got was the opportunity to work with this group.</p>\n<p><em>So you made your way into Financial Services, you really enjoyed the other Principals, and that was that &#8211; it was that easy?</em></p>\n<p>Well, I was a first-year Consultant at that time with no relevant background. My strategy from early on, and advice that I got from others, was to pick folks you really respect and you want to learn from, and then jump in and do whatever you can to help the team. And be very responsive to feedback.</p>\n<p><em>And you must have had recruiters calling you on a weekly basis for different opportunities. Did you ever come close to leaving before the role at Schwab surfaced?</em></p>\n<p>Yes, but it was less from recruiters and more so from clients, because you build really close relationships with your clients. Like many consultants, I got very engrossed and embedded in the work I was doing. So those opportunities definitely did come up and I was very close to making the change a couple of times along the way. I think the reason I didn’t was because I was fortunate enough to develop some great relationships with folks in my class and mentors, and I had a set of frank conversations about these opportunities as they came up. I can still remember sitting outside on a picnic table at a client’s office in New England in late November. Despite how cold we both were, he was incredibly patient about challenging my thinking. He encouraged me to think about a few things: whom I would learn from, what I would learn, and the trajectory that I was setting myself up for. When thought about that way, you do the math and compare two opportunities. If you’re a first-year Consultant, second-year Consultant, first-year Project Leader, or even a Principal, it is still an apprenticeship business and there is so much you can learn on the consulting side, and every time I contemplated it, it still felt a bit early to make that move. So it made sense for me to stay at BCG and to soak up as much as I could. I think that if I didn’t have those relationships and didn’t feel as comfortable being as candid as I was, I might have taken an “I’ve got nothing to lose” attitude and left the firm. Looking back, I don’t think that would have been the right decision, and I’m glad I didn’t leave any earlier than I did.</p>\n<p><em>In spite of the fact that you are someone who didn’t spend her BCG signing bonus out of the fear that she’d have to repay it, did you at any point think to yourself, “Oh, I want to make Partner” or stay ‘X’ number of years?</em></p>\n<p>I never expected to stay as long as I did. It got very sticky. Toward the end, the last year or two, it was starting to become comfortable. When I thought about leaving I would start to think, “Oh I am giving up so much,” which was exactly the opposite of the kind of decision-making I wanted to have. I didn’t want to stay in a role just because it felt comfortable to leave or for a fear of the unknown. As it started to get really comfortable and became the path of least resistance, I promised myself, “I’ve got to at least look outside and make sure I am staying for the right reasons.” And it was really that, plus some changes on the personal front that led me to not want to travel as much. We had our first child and that made me start to think, “Well, let me at least just look,” because I wanted to make an informed decision. I was never one of those people gunning for Partner. Like many folks in these roles, I’m fairly driven but it wasn’t that I had to be in a certain role at a certain time or anything like that.</p>\n<p><em>A certain group of consultants decides to leave after two years, and they usually say that they’ve learned what they “came to firm X” to learn. What are people missing out on by leaving after two years instead of four?</em></p>\n<p>I want to make one point first and then answer your question. If I have learned anything along the way it’s to be humble. Looking back that is one thing that I think is incredibly important. But more specifically, looking at two years versus four years, I think that consulting firms are run by incredibly bright people. They built a system so there is a learning curve with in-step change every couple of years. And the question for me was, “What could I be learning at that step inside the firm and what I could learn at that step outside the firm?” That may be a very selfish way of looking at it, but for me that was the value proposition. Inside a consulting firm experiences are more homogenous. You know what will be expected at each level. When you leave consulting there is a lot more variability and ambiguity around the role and the expectations. After two years at a consulting firm, you are just being promoted into a people-manager role and, at least for me, this was the first time I was really managing a team of any size and it was really the first time I was managing up. Then, at four years, the period transitioning to the pre-Partner level, this is when the stakes change in terms of managing client relationships. Now, for the first time, you have to start trying to take on that trusted advisor role, and that is a tricky thing to do given the level of experience and tenure and differences in background. So you’ve got to have the industry knowledge to understand the problem and then a bit of the empathy to help your client through that. I was hard-pressed to find that opportunity anywhere outside of consulting so I didn’t want to give up the opportunity to work on either of these challenges.</p>\n<p><em>What you gained by staying through those roles of increasing responsibility &#8211; empathy, working with clients, and managing up &#8211; how instrumental have those skills been for you in corporate, either now or as you see they will be in the future, versus those who left consulting earlier and didn’t gain those skills?</em></p>\n<p>I think that the first couple years of consulting for me were figuring out the “what” of a business problem: what is the problem and what is the answer? Then, toward the end of consulting, you are starting to get into the “how”: how do you actually make this change? How do you implement this? I think that is what you are really doing, You are advising your client, you are partnering with your client on how they might do this. The thing that is so exciting to me about corporate, and what I love about my job right now, is that it is all about the “how.” Getting the “what” right, answering that question, is table stakes, but the folks who are really successful are the people who are really able to make something happen. Making something happen in corporate is all about relationships and understanding your partners and understanding where they are coming from and then collaborating really closely and figuring out what role you can have that will add value to the firm and your colleagues. So I think that latter half of consulting, the “EQ” if you will, becomes incredibly important. I mean, there is nothing worse than having a really great answer that sits on the shelf. That is the nightmare for everyone, and I think in many companies if that happens you will be hard-pressed to have your role that many years later.</p>\n<p><em>How did you get to Charles Schwab? Was it a client?</em></p>\n<p>Schwab was not a client of mine. My husband and I spent six years in New York and never planned on it lasting that long because, remember, I was planning on staying at BCG for less than a year right? [Laughing] Then we made our way to the West Coast, and I knew I wanted to stay in Financial Services. I was very excited about Schwab, their history, and reputation, their orientation toward clients and position in the market. This role opened up, I had a set of conversations with folks at Schwab, it felt like a team that I could have fun with, and I believed in what the company was trying to do from a corporate perspective, including their business model and what that meant for their business as well as the impact it would have on clients’ lives.</p>\n<p><em>Did you use transition time with BCG or did you do all of this exploration while still consulting full-time?</em></p>\n<p>I pretty much did this exploration while consulting full-time. It all happened very quickly. I had a grand plan: I would finish up at BCG at the end of the year, and then I would take the next six months just to transition, and I would find that perfect role. The truth of the matter is that happens very quickly and organically. I had a few good conversations and it led to a role. I was opportunistic and it moved a lot more quickly than I originally thought.</p>\n<p><em>What was the structure of the strategy team at Schwab when you joined?</em></p>\n<p>I joined the Retail Strategy team. I was focused on a particular set of priorities that centered on the scalability of our business model. Then we had three or four Managing Directors, equivalent to the Project Leader or Engagement Leader, and a team of Senior Managers and Analysts. In all, the team is about 15-20 people and serves as an intake valve for talent at Schwab, so people typically spend a couple of years in the group and then they role out to another part of the business.</p>\n<p><em>A lot of folks who are at the tenure that you were when you left BCG are reluctant to join a Corporate Strategy team unless they’re leading it. Many have grown apprehensive or jaded about working for large companies, and many are eager to have an operational role right away rather than transition through strategy. Some specifically say that if they’re going to be doing strategy work, they’d rather do it in consulting. You obviously did not share those beliefs. What do folks have wrong by saying that they don’t want to be a VP, that they only want to be the SVP, or that they don’t want to do strategy? What are they missing?</em></p>\n<p>I am so glad you asked that question, because I actually got advice like that when I was leaving. Looking back, I was incredibly fortunate to come to Schwab through the Strategy group. There were enough things changing in that transition from consulting to corporate that it was valuable for me to hit the ground doing work I knew how to do well. The day in and day out process of defining and executing on Strategy projects was something I was very familiar with – I had been doing that at BCG for six years at that point. So I could focus on building relationships and understanding the nuances of the business. The transition was a humbling experience and it helped me realize that the view I had from BCG, while broad, was not complete. It’s also important to be honest with yourself on what excites you about the work you’re doing. I am excited about being able to see the change in the business. I was always focused on the “how.” For some folks, if what you are passionate about is really the pure strategy piece, then maybe you will have a different take.</p>\n<p><em>So the big question is, did you spend your Schwab signing bonus?</em></p>\n<p>I saved it. When I left BCG, I had very frank conversations where I said, “I may be back in three months.” That was the tone of my exit! [Laughing]. I was joking with people, telling them, “Don’t take my name off the door!” and I was only half kidding. I was having conversations with people throughout, wondering if I was going to be going back in three months, six months, or five years. There was a transition initially and the best on-boarding process was like the one at BCG, which was the informal mentorship and coaching from colleagues. You have to seek that out of course, but I think it is really important to invest in those relationships up-front with the folks that you are excited to work with and ask for their help in return, for example, “Help me understand the culture, help me understand where I can add value, help me understand where I can work with you on something that is going to have a lot of impacts.” Those are all things that made the transition stick.</p>\n<p><em>Do you have tips on what consultants can do to best hit the ground running during that transition, let’s say the first 90 days – things they need to make sure they do and things they need to make sure they do not do?</em></p>\n<p>I think that’s a great question. For me, there were two things that really mattered. One: get real responsibility. Don’t take the fluffy projects, so to speak. You want to be doing something meaningful, and it is hard to engage with your partners if you do not take on that responsibility. Two: focus on the relationships, and be very candid with folks about where you are coming from and what you are thinking. Let them know that you want to be successful and you want to add value, and seek out their advice and coaching. I was very deliberate. I had a 90-day plan that I wrote, and I worked on that 90-day plan with my boss. I wanted to make sure that I was thinking about things the right way and that they were invested in it as well. That made a lot of difference. It made what was an ambiguous process very tangible for me. For a lot of folks who are strivers and achievers, having a 90-day plan can be really helpful when you know the results of your work are probably going to be seen three, four, five, six months out. At least you have something you are tracking toward and can measure progress against.</p>\n<p><em>And the 90-day plan was your idea?</em></p>\n<p>Oh yes, and everyone was open to it. We can imagine in certain environments, people going “I have to do this? You are the only person who has ever asked to do that.” You have to read the room a little, and it depends on who you are working with. Some people engaged with it in detail, some wanted to give me a little high-level guidance; you have to meet people where they are.</p>\n<p><em>After less than two years at </em>Schwab<em> you become SVP, Client Experience. How did that new role come about? Can you tell us a little bit about your responsibilities?</em></p>\n<p>I was asked to take this role about three months ago. We had undergone a reorganization to consolidate client experience under one leader, and that is the role I filled. My team is responsible for leading the teams that take the strategy and drive that into the actual offers and experiences we will create for our clients. That is the best way I can describe it. For me, this is the perfect role &#8211; that is what I am always telling everyone. We are able to have a tangible impact and see and measure that day in and day out. Doing this work also requires us to work closely across our Sales and Service Organizations, as well as Technology, Operations, Legal, Compliance, Risk, and Finance. I love the collaborative process that goes along with trying to drive that kind of work. That is what gets me excited day in and day out. Also, I am one step closer to the Financial Services professionals in the branches and the call centers and our clients, which I find very rewarding. After all, the work we are doing is to help our clients meet their financial goals and it is nice to be a little closer to that and to see that impact.</p>\n<p><em>Does this feel like strategy or does it feel like you have left strategy?</em></p>\n<p>[Laughs] I definitely feel like I have left strategy but we still partner closely with the team so it’s not that far away.</p>\n<p>Part of the reason we find your profile exciting is because you left BCG to be a VP of Strategy and two years later you are an SVP of Client Experience. You show how quickly it can work out and go in the right direction, and you show to those who are a bit impatient that patience is a virtue because two years is nothing in the scheme of one’s career.</p>\n<p>I would say that patience has never been one of my virtues and it never will be. For me, not to sound cliché, but I was excited about Schwab. I was excited about the business and wanted to be a part of that story.</p>\n<p><em>You have only been in this role for a few months, so it’s probably too soon to think about what’s next, but where do you see yourself heading in the organization now that you know it better?</em></p>\n<p>I think it is too soon to say that. I love the role that I am in and think there is so much more we can do and have an impact on from where we are sitting, so that is really our focus right now.</p>\n<p><em>You have been involved with a couple of nonprofits: Minds Matter’s San Francisco chapter and The Center for Children’s Initiatives. When did you do that work? How did you make time for it? Do you recommend nonprofit board work to others?</em></p>\n<p>Yes, I absolutely recommend it. I personally find it rewarding, but it is time-consuming. To be honest, most of this work that I did was while I was at BCG and before our second child. So after the second kiddo I have essentially taken a break from that. I feel like right now I have a ton of balls in the air. I look forward to getting involved again in some nonprofit work closer to home. There are priorities that need to get shifted as we go along.</p>\n<p>So yes, I would absolutely recommend it when you can dedicate the time and energy to it, and I found it incredibly rewarding, personally and professionally.</p>\n</div>\n",

      "content": "<div class=\"profile-intro\">Position: VP, Global Strategy and Business Dev.</div>\n<div class=\"profile-intro\"></div>\n<div class=\"profile-intro\">Current Firm: The Gap, Inc.</div>\n<div class=\"profile-intro\"></div>\n<div class=\"profile-intro\">* At the time of this interview Gil was the Executive Director, Global Strategy of The Gap, Inc.</div>\n<div class=\"profile-intro\"></div>\n<div class=\"profile-intro\"><em>Post-undergrad, you earned an MA in Applied Economics and were a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Michigan. What drew you into Huron Consulting Group, and then into A.T. Kearney?</em></div>\n<div class=\"profile-intro\"></div>\n<div class=\"profile-intro\">\n<p>I was in a dual Ph.D. program in Political Science and Applied Economics. Four years in, I decided that though I loved teaching, I would hate being an academic. I hated sitting in a room contemplating my own thoughts for hours on end on an extraordinarily narrow topic. If I had been a superstar on that topic, ten people would have read my first book. I decided I wasn’t going to be an academic and got into consulting for the reason that most people do at that point in their career. I wanted to get into business and knew there were areas, like retail, that I was very passionate about, but I didn’t really know anything about it or where to start. Consulting was kind of the entry point for me.</p>\n<p><em>You spent eleven years in consulting, seven of those at A.T. Kearney. Can you share some thoughts on why you stayed with the firm as long as you did rather than leave for an outside opportunity? Did you always have the goal of becoming Partner throughout your tenure at A.T. Kearney? If not, what elements of your consulting career / experiences put you on the Partner path?</em></p>\n<p>I came in and initially thought I would do it for a couple of years and then exit into industry, then a couple of things happened. One, the pace of my career path kept me in the game. There was always the promise of another level of seniority, another bump in compensation, and another set of challenges. I could have more smart people under me filling in the blanks as I engaged with clients and helped innovate and structure solutions to problems. So as I got closer to the Partner point, I felt like I was absorbed in a broad array of things, many of which were things that really interested me. I felt like I had entrepreneurial control of what I wanted to do, and I felt like I was learning a lot. I think that’s why I stayed.</p>\n<p>At the same time, I think as I was nearing Partner – and even as a Principal – I did start having some desire to pursue an alternate career path outside of consulting. And the truth is that I didn’t find something that I found really compelling until I was into my second year as a Partner, and I took it when it came. Part of that was an impact of the job market in 2009-2012. If the types of opportunities I saw toward the end of my consulting career had popped up earlier, it’s possible that I would have taken the leap earlier.</p>\n<p><em>We’ve seen numerous talented consulting Principals pass on external opportunities because of a prospective Partner promotion, only to be passed over and have the timeline extend another 12-18 months. What type of Project Leader or Principal ought to stay on and shoot for the Partner role? What type should not?</em></p>\n<p>My perspective is that the consulting career development track is geared to focus on Partnership as a prize. It is not geared to having you sit back and look at your professional and personal life and decide what is right for you at that particular moment in your career. My strong recommendation for any Principal would be that very early in your Principal career, you should conduct that assessment and decide where you want to be in the near future, and what makes sense for you both professionally and personally.</p>\n<p>If you conduct that assessment and you want to be a Partner, then the difference of that 18 months in the spectrum of your career is irrelevant. If you ultimately see that your future is outside of consulting, in my experience the industry perceives zero difference between a first-year Principal and a third-year Principal. If you want to go to industry, you might as well go as soon as you’ve made Principal. If you want to make Partner, the twelve-month bump sounds frustrating, but if ultimately you’re going to be a Partner for ten or twenty years, it doesn’t seem like it should matter all that much. That being said, I was fast-tracked to every promotion I had, so maybe that makes it easy to say that. But as Principals have come to me to discuss their careers, that’s the direction I’ve given.</p>\n<p><em>In your experience, how can one take optimism out of the equation and really assess his/her chances at Partner (are there any signs one might see to let him/her know that it isn’t going to be a fit or possibility)?</em></p>\n<p>I was always very direct with A.T. Kearney, and basically said, “Look, here is when I expect to make Partner. There is no up-or-out model here, but I see it as an up-or-out. If you don’t want me as a Partner on the basis of the performance I’ve laid out, then let’s just agree that you don’t want me as a Partner and I’ll go do something else.” I had that conversation a year-and-a-half out with a number of different people, and it wasn’t menacing or threatening. It was just, “Let’s be honest, here’s the performance, I believe it is Partner-level work. Either I’m totally delusional and you need to bring me back down to earth; or it is Partner-level work but you’re unwilling to make me a Partner for some other reason; or it is Partner-level work and at that point let’s just call it what it is.” Maybe others don’t have that conversation. It is also possible they aren’t in the position of strength to have that conversation – I had a strong track record.</p>\n<p>But at the end of the day, becoming a Partner is not a promotion. Becoming a Partner is an election. And that’s true everywhere. There needs to be a core group of Partners who are saying, visibly, audibly, to other Partners, that they believe you should be their peer.</p>\n<p><em>What were the best things about the Partner role for you?</em></p>\n<p>I don’t think that the Partner role was any different than what I would’ve expected beforehand, but talking about it and then living it were different things. There are three major pros. One is compensation, clearly – both immediate compensation and the promise of future compensation. The second is status. Being on the top of your profession and being acknowledged for that means something, and actually is harder to walk away from than I had expected, though I never thought of myself as somebody who was all that involved in the trappings of being a Partner. The third pro is flexibility. This differs depending on your firm, but at A.T. Kearney, in general, you don’t have to be on the ground every day delivering things as a Partner. There will be spikes where you have to be, but if you are regularly sitting over the shoulder of execution teams, you are probably not being an effective Partner and you are not enabling your teams to be effective teams. You have to let them execute and forge the relationships and do the right things, even if that means they sometimes make a mistake. The flexibility you ultimately get is quite great. You can find yourself with a Tuesday where you don’t necessarily have to be anywhere. You have some work to do – and there is always work to do – but you have flexibility. If you are someone who can enjoy that, and you are somebody who is able to take advantage of that flexibility when it comes up unpredictably, that’s a great thing.</p>\n<p><em>Along with the pros of being a Partner at a top consulting firm come the rumored cons. What were the worst things about the role for you?</em></p>\n<p>One is that the stress level is, in some ways, much greater. I think this differs from firm to firm, but one of the things that is talked about among some of the Partners that I know is that when you’re a Principal the phone rings all the time. All of the Partners want you to help make their business pursuits and projects successful. A weird thing that happens is a lot of that phone ringing stops when you make Partner. You’re another mouth to feed. You’re someone who potentially shares the credit if you’re brought in, and you’re certainly someone who burns through budget if you start showing up on the ground every day. There are many people who continue to see you as a collaborator, but there are some others who now see you as a bit of a threat. The phone rings less.</p>\n<p>You’re primarily accountable for business development in a way that may not be entirely clear to you how to do. The business development process is one that is much more long-term, non-linear, and intangible in its interim results than the type of work product you’ve traditionally been used to at this point. You’re used to projects with a timeline, deliverables, and a conclusion, as opposed to, “I’ve had all of these conversations, and at some point, I will be positioned to pursue a business opportunity when it comes up.”</p>\n</div>\n<p>Sometimes business development is just a bunch of conversations to help people that you like and respect think through problems. You’re investing time thinking through things, talking to people, meeting them, talking about their issues, and trying to be helpful in a way that you believe they’ll pick up the phone as opportunities come up for them to work with you. There’s no way to pressure sell consulting services. You’re just trying to be helpful in an authentic way. And you just have to trust that will pay dividends. I think that most Partners feel anxiety about whether it’s paying dividends their entire career. That insecurity is an inherent part of being Partner, and it follows most Partners for most of their career. A year and a half into being Partner, I was finally seeing the point at which I was an independent driver of business, with no need to rely on other Partners, though with a strong interest in partnering with them as a peer. The seeds that I had planted were going to bear fruit over a five- to ten-year period, and I was going to continue to plant seeds throughout that period. But the stress of that process is the second big con.</p>\n<p>The third con is the inconsistency and unpredictability of the work and the travel. When you’re a Manager, you know you’re going to this client for 3-4 months, 3-4 days per week. Maybe you’ll have times when you’re traveling to multiple client locations. My experience as a Partner was finding out on Thursday that you have to be somewhere else in the world on Tuesday. The client doesn’t care what you’re leaving when you do that, or whether you had other client commitments that you now have to fill simultaneously – you’re just going.</p>\n<p>So from a quality of life standpoint, on the one hand, I had these newfound points of flexibility. I’m a competitive triathlete. I’ve raced in a couple of national championship triathlons. I loved the fact that there would be a random Wednesday where I didn’t have to be in until 10:00 and I could go for a 45-mile bike ride.</p>\n<p><em>Who hasn’t done that on a Wednesday morning, right?</em></p>\n<p>I mean, it’s awesome! You’re getting Partner compensation and can go on a 45-mile bike ride on a Wednesday morning! But on the other hand, I was constantly having this conversation with my wife: “Can you meet our friends for dinner on Tuesday?” “I don’t know.” “When are you going to be home tonight?” “I don’t know.” “Can we make plans to see your mother in a month?” “I don’t know.” And at some point that gets so taxing on your quality of life. For me, that overrode the benefits of flexibility. And that unpredictability skyrockets as a Partner.</p>\n<p><em>As a Partner, you continued to train for triathlons. How did you balance that?</em></p>\n<p>I’ve tried to stay a competitive athlete throughout my consulting career. I always saw it as a priority. I trained five or six days a week. As long as I can get 5 hours of sleep, I’d rather train for an hour than sleep for an extra hour and fifteen minutes. It will make me more levelheaded, it will make my mind clearer, it will help me focus, it will help me burn off steam… I would rather train for an hour than go to a team dinner. I would rather train for an hour and if it means I have to take a slightly later flight home, so be it. Once you make it a priority, you find ways to fit it in.</p>\n<p><em>How did you learn about the opportunity at Gap?</em></p>\n<p>It happened pretty quickly. The immediate cause of the conversation with Gap was that A.T. Kearney went to engage with Gap on a business development pursuit. As a secondary consequence of that, I struck up a relationship with an A.T. Kearney alum who, at that point, was Head of Strategy for Gap. And that conversation, which I initially saw as a business development relationship, transitioned into a job opportunity.</p>\n<p>At that point the job market had started to heat up, and I had been approached by three former clients for job opportunities at the same time, and the net result got me thinking seriously about what I wanted to find outside of consulting.</p>\n<p><em>What made the opportunity at Gap so much more appealing than the other opportunities?</em></p>\n<p>One, it was apparel retail. Some of the others were not, and that was the area where I feel the most passionate. If I wanted to learn the apparel retail business, what better place than Gap? If you look at the number of people in leadership positions of other companies who are Gap alums, it feels like Gap is sort of the Harvard MBA of the apparel world. So it feels like an incredible place to learn the ropes.</p>\n<p>Two, I felt like Gap was in a very interesting time in its history, where it had struggled as of late and was in a cathartic moment both for its business model and for its brand. I felt I could really play a strong role in determining whether it could succeed in that critical moment.</p>\n<p>Three, I met most of a brand new leadership team and was very much energized by the way they engaged with each other, their view of the business, their honesty about the issues they had, and their honesty about the changes that would have to be made and the difficulty of doing that, both from a business perspective and from a cultural perspective. I was also energized by their level of interest and investment in seeing me grow, not just as a strategist, but as a talent within the business to help drive the business as I got to know how it was run.</p>\n<p>Part of the frustration I always had with consulting is that even for the best clients I’ve ever had, a great brand and a great retailer will only let a consultant so far into the company. The nature of the brand, the product… they may let you touch a piece of it, but you won’t get to drive it. My first hour of my first day at Gap, I was brought in for an HR orientation. I was pulled out of that meeting 45 minutes in because I was told I really needed to come into another meeting.</p>\n<p>I was then thrown into the middle of an initiative to redefine the essence and DNA of the Gap brand, to focus that DNA more squarely on the consumer that it sought to capture. They did so through a visual and strategic branding exercise that immediately put me in a room with a set of communications people, apparel design people, and marketing creative people, building that sort of visual identity with things like mood boards and imagery to define what the brand was, what it stood for, and what it was not. And that’s something that I’ve always wanted to do. Even if I had participated in small pieces in the course of my consulting career, I had never done so with the level of empowerment of which I saw myself in my second hour at Gap.</p>\n<p><em>What advice would you have for a Partner at a top firm who is thinking about leaving and wondering how to identify and secure the best next opportunity?</em></p>\n<p>It’s really, really important to seek your own definition of success. I was thinking about taking this job at Gap, and I was a bit hesitant because the compensation was a little lower, the esteem of being a Partner would be gone, and I’d have to put all my suits in storage (laughs). I had just become a Partner and I was going to make all this money, I was going to fly around the world, I was going to get all these clients… I just started building this list of all of the things I had been told. At some point I had to sit down and really define what success meant for me. Gap was slightly lower compensation. I wasn’t going to have as large a team. But I had to define success for myself. Success for myself professionally meant diving into this industry I was really passionate about, and having access to – and driving – solutions focused on the consumer. And that’s really what infatuates me.</p>\n<p>I could sit in a mall for hours and watch people go through that mall, and think about why they acknowledged one sign over another, or why they chose to go into that store over another. I could sit and watch the way that a person goes into a store, looks across a set of merchandise, and at some point wants to reach out and touch a folded garment on a shelf. I’m interested in the ways in which touching becomes picking up, and ultimately becomes buying. At what point do they check the price? I’m infatuated with all of that, and that was a priority for me professionally. Being able to tell my wife when I was going to be home at night was another big priority for me. And ultimately, when we choose to start a family, being able to be a father in the way that I’d like to be was a really big priority for me.</p>\n<p>There were all these other things that I ultimately decided were other people’s definition of success. While hard to part with, they were ultimately not the things that were going to make me happy. They were the things that were going to surround me with the trappings of happiness. So the advice I have is, one of the hardest but most important things for a Principal or a Partner thinking of leaving consulting is to step outside of the consulting rat race in which they find themselves, and really define for themselves what’s important to them.</p>\n<p>By the way, I know people for whom it is really important to wear amazing suits and make sure they are in luxury hotels on their vacations, and that makes them really happy. And there’s nothing wrong with that. And there are people who are true consulting workaholics, in the most non-pejorative sense, who love flying around the world and making deals, and shaking hands, and making business happen, sometimes irrelevant of what the topic is. And those people are made for consulting and would be miserable doing what I do.</p>\n<p>I think it’s really about defining what’s going to make you happy, and separating yourself from all of the things you are being told about how to define your happiness.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p class=\"profile-intro\">Position: SVP, Marketing and Strategy</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">Current Firm: Ross Stores, Inc.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>Please give a quick recap of your career with BCG (approximately 13 years). Can you share some thoughts on why you stayed as long as you did rather than leave for an outside opportunity? Did you always have the goal of becoming Partner throughout your tenure at BCG?</em></p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">I joined BCG right out of college. I was one of the few people I’ve ever heard of who knew they wanted to be a consultant even when growing up, and that’s because my father was a consultant. I really thought I would be a lifelong consultant. I didn’t have an aspiration to do something else. I really loved it &#8211; I loved the type of work, I like client service, and I liked the people I worked with quite a bit. So I wasn’t particularly looking.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">But I do think there’s a part of people staying in consulting because of inertia. It was the only thing I knew, and I didn’t know there could be other opportunities that would be as exciting and fulfilling with people I enjoyed working with as much. I didn’t really start looking at all. I ended up going to a client I had become quite enamored with versus doing a search.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>You worked in three different offices at BCG – Atlanta, NYC, and San Francisco. What were the pros/cons of changing offices? Folks often say that changing offices has a negative effect on their upward trajectory. How did you avoid that?</em></p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">It helped me build a much wider network than others could have. I drew upon that network quite a bit as I progressed through my career. My earlier transfer didn’t impact me at all, but to transfer late in your career can be very damaging. So much of making Partner isn’t just about how capable you are, it’s about being established in commercial relationships with a strong set of Partners who are vouching for you. To try to rebuild that late in your career can be very challenging.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">In fact, that’s one of the reasons I stayed in the New York City office longer than my husband and I wanted to because I thought the penalty for transferring would be too great. Ultimately, I was able to make Partner on the West Coast. I think it probably cost me a year in my promotion timing, but I was lucky enough to have very strong relationships across the country with some of the key decision makers in the firm. I don’t know that my experience is completely analogous to everybody else’s.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>With the “up or out” model well-known across consulting firms, only a select few make it to – and can cut it at – the Partner level. In a sea of some of the world’s brightest minds, how does one stand out?</em></p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">To stand out, you need to be very capable at what you’re doing &#8211; that’s obvious. I was never the smartest person at BCG, but I think I had a pragmatic approach to consulting and a very high degree of client-service orientation and strength at building relationships. Those are the standard things that help people stand out. One of the ways I built strong relationships was through loyalty to the Partners I worked with. One of the mistakes I see consultants make is when they say, “That project sounds interesting! And that project sounds interesting!” but then “I know I’ve worked with you on the last couple of projects, and you completely invested everything in me, but this next project doesn’t sound as interesting so I’m going to do a different project.” They don’t realize how powerful it is to have two-way loyalty between a Partner or a Principal and a Consultant. So I stuck with a group of people that I respected a lot and who were influential in the firm, through exciting projects, and through some super crappy projects. And that investment in them made them more willing to invest back in me.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>We’ve seen numerous talented senior consultants decline external opportunities because of a prospective Partner promotion, only to be passed over and have the promotion timeline extend another 12-18 months. What type of consultant ought to stay on and shoot for the Partner role? What type should not?</em></p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">I can relate to that because at the time I never would have considered leaving right before making Partner. But in reality, you can be a top 10% performer your entire consulting career and still not make Partner because of not having the right support from a Partner group. Or, honestly, because of things outside of your control, like there are too many people who have been promoted recently in your practice, or there are too many Junior Partners… I was supposed to make Partner during the downturn, and that was out of my control. People who have been successful their entire careers don’t realize that does not automatically transfer into making Partner. Also, so much of making Partner is about your commercial platform and your commercial ability.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">I’ve also noticed that some people have this crazy need to make Partner, but they don’t ever think about whether they would actually like the job of being a Partner. It’s not like you make it across a finish line when you make Partner &#8211; that is just the beginning! The pressure is absolutely enormous to bring in revenue and build-out clients. Unless you’re someone who really likes to be in what is basically a sales-oriented role, it may not be a role that you like. I did not like it as much as I thought I would because I really like content and problem-solving, but I did not like having to sell work.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">There were other aspects I loved about being a Partner, but people should really think about whether it is worth passing on good opportunities while waiting and killing yourself to make Partner. You really need to take a look at the Partners around you and ask yourself, “Is this something I want to do?”</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>We also see senior consultants who have not received strong messaging that they will make Partner but are optimistic and think that they will anyway. How can one take optimism out of the equation and really assess his/her chances at Partner?</em></p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">Unless you have an influential and successful senior Partner with a big book of business specifically saying, “I will take you through to the end and support you even after you make Partner,” then I think you are kidding yourself. If you are not getting that absolutely explicit input, not just from the office head but literally from the person who is going to write your sponsorship recommendation and support you as you go through, it’s either not going to happen or even if it does you will flounder as a Junior Partner. You really need that Senior Partner coverage to be successful.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>What were the best things about the Partner role for you, and what were the worst?</em></p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">I loved being part of office leadership. I invested a lot of time and energy into people, and I loved that from the Partner vantage point, I had a lot more information and a lot more power to help people in their careers. I liked making decisions as part of the Partner group, particularly since I had so much respect for my fellow Partners. It was really cool to be a part of that leadership team.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">I also loved the increased access I had to senior clients. You get that when you’re a Principal, but it’s of a different nature when you have the Partner title and the Partner position. And I loved the intellectual leadership. I liked continuing to take what I did as a Principal to the next level and feeling like I was really accountable for the answer.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">But I did not like the commercial side. Frankly, I wasn’t as good at the commercial side as I had expected I would be. Some people really like that side, too. You just have to realize that’s the single biggest difference in the role between Principal and Partner.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>Very much to your credit, your reputation at BCG was sterling and now serves as a helpful tool in recruiting for your team at Ross. What firm building and non-client focused efforts did you find most meaningful? Anything that made you a better consultant, Partner, or leader in general?</em></p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">I did a lot of different things &#8211; I put in place a mentorship program when I was in New York, and I worked on recruiting. But I’d say the thing that was most rewarding was my involvement in the Women’s Initiative at BCG, which I thought was a very honest, candid, and impactful approach to supporting women. We spent a lot of effort and involved a lot of the male leadership in taking an individualized approach to keeping women at BCG longer. I ran the Women’s Initiative for the West Coast, and that was very rewarding.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>How did you learn about the opportunity at Ross, and what made it so appealing?</em></p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">I’m probably a little different in that I really wasn’t that interested in leaving consulting. So just hearing about an opportunity while I was really busy and happy at BCG… there just wasn’t going to be enough of a draw there. A lot of people have to have the draw plus a real readiness to leave.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">For me, it was just serendipitous. There wasn’t a specific opportunity at Ross. They made the opportunity for me because they wanted me to join. I hadn’t worked with such a strong, well-run company as Ross before. I looked at the company, the business model and growth, the management team, and the upward opportunities that growth would provide, and I just thought, “Wow, what am I waiting for? This is a really good company.” And a lot of the things that I enjoyed about consulting I could see at Ross, like feeling as though you’re making an impact. I really wanted to make sure my work was addressing the most important issues in the company. It’s much harder when you haven’t worked with a company as a client to really see whether those things are true. Of course, a company will tell you that you’ll be working on impactful things and that you can move into operational roles, but that’s so much harder to see unless you’ve worked in the company. But I think if I had done a lot of due diligence, I still could have learned that about Ross.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>What advice would you have for a Partner at a top firm who is thinking about leaving and wondering how to identify and secure the best next opportunity?</em></p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">BCG is incredibly networked, and I think sometimes people don’t fully take advantage of that network because they don’t want to show their cards if they’re leaving. Honestly, every Partner I know has thought about leaving at some point, so if you talk to someone else about that thought, nobody thinks you’re crazy or disloyal. I really think it is about networking and taking advantage of all of the connections and relationships that are even within the firm.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>As SVP of Strategy and Marketing at Ross Stores, what skills do you utilize from your time in consulting, specifically from your experience at the Partner level?</em></p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">Well, a lot of obvious skills, like problem-solving. Not just basic problem-solving, but going a level deeper to make sure we aren’t drawing superficial conclusions. A lot of my role is looking at data in different ways than other people would, to try to uncover opportunities or issues. Also, relationship building is important and being able to facilitate challenging discussions across diverse opinion leaders in the company.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">One of the things that is most helpful is my ability to deal with fragmentation. I have three groups, and at any given time I’m working on 10 projects on two coasts while also running a Marketing department. When you’re a Partner, you tend to get very fragmented, which helps you figure out, “where do I spend my time? Where do I dive deep? Where do I take a step back?” and how to set deadlines when many things are happening at the same time. That has been incredibly, incredibly helpful. And then the final thing is just getting up to speed very quickly on new topics, which you have to do in consulting all of the time.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>Are there any skills you hadn’t utilized as often in consulting, which you needed to get up to speed? How has it been different “on the inside”, both pros and cons?</em></p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">The single biggest thing that I’ve had to work on is making myself less of a consultant, and I was considered on the pragmatic side for a consultant. But when I got to Ross, I was still full of consultant language and jargon, and I wanted to present beautiful charts when the entire thing could be summarized in four words. I had to undo a lot of that consultant mindset and communication to be able to work effectively with the very diverse types of people we have at Ross. We have a bunch of ex-consultants, a bunch of people who made their way up through stores, and a bunch of merchants.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">We pay attention to that aspect while recruiting consultants. If someone comes off as ridiculously consultant-y and academic, they’re going to struggle to be successful at Ross.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>How did you ramp up to lead the Marketing function and team for a Fortune 500 company? Do you think it is easier or more difficult to get into marketing as a senior-level consultant?</em></p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">I think it&#8217;s really difficult to go from being a consultant to being a marketing practitioner, or the person who is literally buying the media, working with agencies, developing creative, et cetera. I did not have that experience. I had a lot of marketing strategy experience and brand strategy experience. I’m able to do it because I came in at such a senior level that I’m much more in the role of giving strategic direction, and I have a very strong team of trained marketing practitioners reporting into me. That’s why it works for me. At my level, I feel like I could run just about any department, because it is about giving more strategic direction, as long as you have very strong people beneath you who know the function.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">If someone wanted to go from being a consultant to truly a marketing practitioner or brand manager role, I think he or she would be most successful doing that at a more junior level. I think the transition and ability to succeed would be more challenging at the level between my role and the more junior practitioner level. You’d really need to know that the head of marketing will support a multi-year transition for you to go from Consultant to Marketer. There are years of experience that you just won’t have yet but that are critical to success in the role.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>Having spent most of your later years at BCG focused on CPG, you chose to start your corporate career in a different area (off-price retail). What advice do you have for top consultants </em>re:<em> industry specifically when looking at corporate opportunities?</em></p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">I think so much of industry is transferrable. I’m not trying to say I could have gone from CPG to Biomedical Engineering, but when I am hiring people, sure, retail familiarity is useful, but it’s really not a defining criterion because I know how quickly ex-consultants can get up to speed in a new industry. I would say not to be limited in thinking about industry. What I like about CPG is the customer orientation, which of course also exists in retail. So think about the characteristics of different businesses. I really like the combination that retail has &#8211; tons of data but also the softer, qualitative side, and that combination probably exists in other areas as well. So I was thinking about the characteristics versus truly the exact industry.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>Now that you have spent some time in </em>industry<em>, what advantages do you think off-price retail offers folks who are thinking of careers in consumer and retail more broadly?</em></p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">If someone wants to do something extremely specific, like “my aspiration in life is to run an e-commerce company,” then I understand that is a very specific type of experience that you want to get. But I think if people want to be in more general management leadership roles, they need to look at how a company is run and whether it has been successful, and whether the business model has a lot of staying power. I emphasize that about Ross. Some people question, “Well, off-price is so specific, is it going to be transferrable to other types of retail?” I think every retailer has specific nuances, but what you learn at a company like Ross is how to make great business decisions and the different functions of retail. In terms of a general management type of experience, you’ll get it more from a well-run company where you can learn from the most senior people in the company, versus going to a crappily-run company that has certain characteristics that you’re looking for &#8211; like that they do e-commerce, or that they’re a department store.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>Do you have any tips for how to hit the ground running in corporate, besides losing some of that corporate jargon?</em></p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">We do something that I think is terrific, and other companies may not have this degree of flexibility, but we really tell people not to try to make an impact for the first three months. That’s really difficult for consultants who are used to the “I have to add value” mindset, and it’s anxiety-producing to wonder “what do I have to show for myself after three months.” But in reality, there are so many things you think make sense when you first come in, but once you learn more about the company, they either don’t make sense, or you can be more influential because you have more context. So we encourage new hires to meet as many people as possible, learn as much as they can about the business, go work in stores, go with the merchants out buying, or whatever is analogous to another industry, and keep track of all the questions and thoughts that you think you want to come back to later as you make an impact. But don’t try to do it in the first three months, because you may only have one shot at certain projects. The other thing is, don’t hire anyone in the first three months unless you absolutely need to because you’ll learn much more about who is going to be successful in the culture. That’s the opposite of your “hitting the ground running” question, but to me, it’s really worth going slow to go fast. I, and many other people are just chomping at the bit, and that can be a disservice.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">Also, I started working with an executive coach about nine months after I started at Ross, which was really helpful for me. I knew how to be successful at BCG, but it was less obvious how people saw me at Ross, how to be successful at Ross, and how to get rid of all of that consultant jargon. That was a really helpful experience for me. It was also a weird experience, because I thought, “Does this mean that I’m not doing as well as I could?” but in reality it was more like, “Let’s invest in making this transition from being a consultant into industry as successful as possible so that Delaney can have a long run here.”</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>You have multiple Managers, Senior Managers, Directors, Senior Directors, and VPs on your expanded Strategy team. What separates a Director from a Senior Director? What must one do in the interviews to show he or she is at the Senior Director level versus Director or is it purely tenure-based?</em></p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">Well, I’d say it’s first based on tenure. But then many people are on that line. And you look at things like two people might be a Principal at BCG, but one person has prior work experience and is much more experienced in his or her career overall. We don’t have a grid showing that someone who graduated in year X is therefore at Y level.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">A Senior Director at Ross is a very senior role. We don’t hire a Senior Director unless we think that person could be one of the future SVPs of the company. It’s a very high bar. So we’re looking at them in the way that we look at our VPs and ask, can they have a one-on-one conversation with our CEO? We wouldn’t expect Directors to be able to do that. You can just tell that in people&#8217;s maturity, and whether their dialogue is strategic and back-and-forth, and whether they ask good questions. The number of years someone spent in consulting can be very influential. There is a difference between a Junior Principal and a Senior Principal in terms of the number of years of experience they’ve had presenting and facilitating conversations with senior leaders.</p>\n",

      "content": "<hr />\n<p><b>1. Pick a Theme, not a Title:</b></p>\n<p>Fantastic opportunities are “quite random,” according to Usman Rabbani, Director and Technology Operating Lead at KKR Capstone. In light of this, he advises, “don’t manage your career around specific jobs or titles or companies or even sectors, but pick a theme that you care about… and then be very flexible around that theme.”</p>\n<p>For Rabbani, that theme is information technology as it relates to business. For Andrew Townend, CFO of PepsiCo Australia &amp; New Zealand, that theme is mobility. Townend chose his first role at PepsiCo “not because of the specific role, but because of the career trajectory that was being positioned for me. It was really about the theme of mobility: global mobility, long-term upward mobility, and functional mobility – the chance to work across the finance function in a range of strategic and operational roles.”</p>\n<p><b>2. Don’t Be Afraid to Be Different:</b></p>\n<p>Rabbani admits it “was kind of weird” to work in a hospital as a software developer while his peers joined Yahoo and Amazon, but it also helped differentiate his resume. His advice: “Don’t be afraid to be different in the choices that you make, especially early in your career when you have the flexibility to take some of those risks.”</p>\n<p><b>3. Ask the Right Questions:</b></p>\n<p>A flexible mindset will expand your opportunity set. Townend believes there are two key questions to ask when an opportunity arises:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">&#8211; Is this experience going to stretch and develop my skills?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">&#8211; Is this going to be rewarding in terms of the elements that are important to me as an individual?</p>\n<p><b>4. Let Go of the Idea of a Fixed Path</b></p>\n<p>Townend recommends viewing your career as “a series of differentiated critical experiences.” He adds, “generally I am on a global finance path, and would expect to continue to do CFO roles, but there is not really an ideal or fixed path.”</p>\n<p>Vatsa Narasimha, CFO &amp; Chief Strategy Officer of OANDA, would agree. “It’s so difficult to predict anything… How much planning can you really do? Most of my friends have all changed jobs significantly. So all of that leads me to believe that as long as you don’t do things that get you on the cover of the Wall Street Journal for the wrong reasons, you’ll be fine. At least I hope so. Fingers crossed.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Position: Director, Information Technology Lead</p>\n<p>Current Firm: KKR Capstone</p>\n<p><em class=\"profile-intro\">Take me through your early career, from Massachusetts General </em><em>Hospital</em>,<em> to Scient, to Pfizer, and finally to starting your own company. How did your career outlook change at each step?</em></p>\n<p>Originally, I planned to become a physician. I was Pre-Med in college, but I also majored in Computer Science and Psychology. I found that technology intersected with medicine and biology in an interesting way, and I wanted to connect my practical goal of becoming a doctor to the things that I really enjoyed doing in technology. I thought I would become a surgeon, but I decided that before signing away eight years of my life to medical school, I should try something that I knew I was excited about. That’s how I ended up at Massachusetts General Hospital. I was a software developer building electronic medical records and physician support systems, and working on how algorithms could help physicians make better healthcare. It was an attempt to keep my foot in two different worlds – healthcare and technology.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>As you moved forward, did you commit more to the technology side?</em></p>\n<p>What happened at Mass General was that I got first-hand exposure to the evolution of medical care in the US and I realized that I did not want to be a physician at all. However, it was clear to me that I enjoyed working with technology, and it was a very exciting time to be in technology, so I decided to double down on that. I got my Masters in Computer Science and then left Mass General for a technology company, Scient, where we were building technology platforms for small startups and midsize companies.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>And after that, you went to Pfizer.</em></p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">At that point, I was still very interested in the impact that technology could have in for-profit healthcare. Pfizer had an emerging technologies group that looked at these issues, and I thought that I could combine my interest in technology and software with a sector that I believed was ripe for technology innovation. But in retrospect, I was right on the opportunity, but wrong on the timing. People today are still talking about the impact technology can have in healthcare, and the conversation is pretty much where it was in the ’90s. At the very least, Pfizer and the pharmaceutical industry wasn’t the right place to drive change. I learned a lot about enterprise technology in the process of discovering that, though.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>And it was there that you decided to go to business school, correct?</em></p>\n<p>Yes. I knew that I wanted to leave Pfizer, and I knew that I wanted to change some things in my career. At that point, I kind of gave up on healthcare. I wanted to make a much bigger difference than I was able to make, and the industry was so big and so complex, and the issues so rooted in politics and regulation, that I felt we were ten, twenty, maybe even thirty years away from technology making a meaningful impact there. I started focusing on the software and tech sector itself – I wanted to join a technology company at that point. I thought business school could be an interesting opportunity to reset, reboot, and look for new opportunities.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>What career options were you considering post-business school? What drew you into McKinsey?</em></p>\n<p>I had a lot of offers to join technology companies, both small and large, but I just couldn’t get excited about any of them for one reason or another. I also had an offer from McKinsey, and because I couldn’t figure out which company I was most excited about, I joined McKinsey to buy myself some more time. I thought I would be there for two years maximum before leaving to join a technology company, or to start my own company. I had started my own company during business school, and that was a great experience. But while I was evaluating these options in my first two years at McKinsey, I grew to love the Firm, the people, and how much I was learning and growing. Before I knew it I was elected Partner, and I was able to focus exclusively on technology. But the funny thing is I joined McKinsey with a very specific plan to leave McKinsey, and I left McKinsey having just written a very specific plan to stay at McKinsey. So you never know how these things will happen.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>How would you describe the transition from CTO and software development work to McKinsey? Was it easy from day one?</em></p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">No, it was a tough transition because I had to unlearn a lot of things. I had been working in a variety of different settings, including larger organizations, and in roles with more responsibility. At McKinsey, I had to reset. Most of my peers at that time were people who had worked for a couple of years had gone to business school, and then joined as an Associate, whereas I had close to ten years of experience when I joined. And that experience didn’t make any difference in the first couple of years because the first two years in consulting are about building basic, intrinsic problem-solving skills and learning how to work with teams and experts. It was very painful but very necessary, and in retrospect, it was probably the best investment I ever made in my career. I had to let go of everything I thought I knew .. and became a clean slate, and retrained myself to do a wider range of things in different ways. McKinsey is very good when it comes to that kind of professional development and mentorship.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>Do you feel your experience prior to McKinsey gave you a leg up in other ways? For example, a lot of consultants tend to be generalists, but it seems that you were able to specialize more than most.</em></p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">For the first two or three years I don’t think my pre-McKinsey experience made any difference, but in years four and five, it really helped me build better client relationships, be more effective with large teams, and be a better leader within McKinsey. All of the experience kicked in during those years.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>You spent 8 years at McKinsey and left as a Partner. The tech world was on fire at this time, and we’re sure you were called by recruiters regularly – what made you stay?</em></p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">When technology started to really heat up, I got a lot of calls from recruiters. I used to seriously consider one or two opportunities every year, and I think that’s a healthy habit for people in management consulting. But I never found a mix of things that was as compelling as what McKinsey had to offer until Raines International called about the role at KKR. At that time, I had written a plan to stay at McKinsey for the rest of my career, so while I was open to new opportunities, I felt that there were very few things that could be as compelling as what I had. KKR happened to be one of them.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>What did the KKR role have those other opportunities lacked?</em></p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">I felt that the KKR opportunity had everything that I valued at McKinsey, and then much more. The people, the professional development, the level of responsibility, the autonomy, and the sense of ownership are all unbelievable at KKR. The quality of future opportunities is probably higher here than at McKinsey. And one of the biggest things for me was content that I personally am excited about. At McKinsey, even though I was focusing on technology, I didn’t have the luxury of only focusing on technology. McKinsey is a client service firm, and you have to do whatever the client needs done, even if that client is a tennis ball manufacturer in Idaho. If there’s a tech client, that’s great, but if there isn’t, you still have to stay busy. At KKR, I focus on technology 100% of the time, whether on the investing side or operating side of the role. So the role was perfectly designed around my interests.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>Did you hesitate to relocate?</em></p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">No, not really. I’ve sort of known all along that my career was going to be in technology, and for probably too long I tried to make it work in New York City against the grain. The opportunity to move to the heart of Silicon Valley, where it’s all about technology, was a no-brainer. This just made all the sense in the world.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>Your role is pretty different from others that we’ve seen, even within the context of private equity. How would you describe your role? What was it about your experience that made you a fit for such a unique role?</em></p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">Half of my role is to look at new technology investments and be credible with entrepreneurs and management teams. The other half of my role is to lead technology operations across the private equity portfolio and be credible with CIO’s and CxO’s. They were looking to check a number of boxes, and luckily, I had all those boxes checked. I think they were looking for someone with a technical degree and a technical background, with hands-on software development and technology experience, large enterprise IT experience, and some entrepreneurial exposure, at a Partner or above level at one of the Top 3 consulting firms. Of course, I didn’t plan it this way, but somehow I ended up doing all these things at some point so it was a good fit.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>Have you had any insights in your new role that you wish you could share with your younger self, which would have impacted how you did your job at McKinsey?</em></p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">Believing what I believe now about how fantastic opportunities come along (it’s quite random), I’d say don’t manage your career around specific jobs or titles or companies or even sectors, but pick a theme that you care about. For me, that theme was information technology in the business world. And then be very flexible around that theme. Being in a hospital as a software developer was kind of weird at a time when people were going to Yahoo and Amazon, but it helped me differentiate a bit. Don’t be afraid to be different in the choices that you make, especially early in your career when you have the flexibility to take some of those risks?</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>Have you had any big surprises at KKR, maybe something that was unexpected or drastically different from consulting?</em></p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">One surprise I’ve had is that people don’t communicate via email as much as we did at McKinsey or other organizations where we had long, detailed email threads. And also, people don’t generate documentation unless it’s absolutely necessary.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>Do you think that’s in the name of efficiency?</em></p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">There are confidentiality, archival and retention and compliance reasons for this, but it’s also cultural. It still feels like a family and relationship-based firm &#8230; and Henry and George are trying to preserve that culture because it has historically led to great performance. It also goes back to what matters and how to have impact, and asking whether spending four hours preparing a document for a meeting is actually going to lead to a better investment outcome or not.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>Do you have any pointers for Engagement Managers, Associate Principals, and Partners on how to be better consultants?</em></p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">I think most people know what matters but the day to day sometimes pushes it to the background – it’s all about the impact you can have in a specific situation, and changing the trajectory of people and/or companies in a material way. Sometimes it takes analysis and data and compelling documents to convince people, and sometimes it takes going to lunch with an executive for 10 months in a row to build a relationship and influence their thinking. I think all consulting firms at a macro level care about having impact, but at the micro level, there are sometimes layers that create insulation and drive research, activity, and analysis instead of impact. I didn’t ask myself and my teams often enough, “How is what we’re doing (right now, in this meeting, on this document, on this analysis, etc.) going to impact the trajectory of this client?” It’s important to have a clear line of sight to the difference you think your work will make.</p>\n",

I didn’t have to know them super well or be best friends with them, but I had a relationship with Robert Reffkin [CEO of Urban Compass, ex-McKinsey] and knew some other folks at the company.</p>\n<p>6) <strong>Equity</strong>: “Finally, I thought it was important that there was an equity component in some form. No matter what, I wanted to feel a deep personal investment in the success of the business.”</p>\n<p>Ultimately, David says, “I looked at a lot of different options, but tried to keep those criteria in mind. <strong>I figured I’d reasonably get four out of six, and the opportunity at Compass was six of six</strong>.”</p>\n<p>For more on David Snider’s experience at Compass, the skills he believes are most important to his success, and the type of consultant he seeks to hire, read the full interview.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<hr />\n<h6 style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>We Work office, Boston South Station. Image courtesy <a href=\"http://www.wework.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.wework.com</a></em></h6>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">If you read last week’s blog, you’re already aware of some things to consider when evaluating an opportunity. But if you’re interested in pursuing a role at a startup company, there are a few more specific things you should keep in mind. Take this advice from former consultants who have found success in startups:</p>\n<p><strong>Do it for the Right Reasons:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Frankly, you should just go into a startup expecting it to fail, because that’s actually the most realistic outcome. Then ask yourself, “If this fails, do I still want to do this?” If you’re doing it because you want multi-million dollar outcomes, then you’re delusional because that’s a highly unlikely outcome. If you’re doing it because it’s a great team, the product is interesting, the space is exciting, and you’re going to learn something that you’ve never had a chance to learn before, those are good reasons to do it.</em></p>\n<p>&#8211; Arjun Moorthy, VP, Business Development &amp; Channel Sales, Hubspot | Boston Consulting Group Alum</p>\n<p><strong>Be Prepared for Change:</strong></p>\n<p><em>The biggest lesson I’ve learned from Voxy is that I’ve messed up absolutely everything at least once, and I’m still here, because I can either lick my wounds and sit there feeling sorry for myself, or I can get up, realize no one really cares about excuses and try to find another thing that will work. It’s all a huge trial and error and it takes mental fortitude to get through all those errors.</em></p>\n<p>&#8211; Paul Gollash, Founder &amp; CEO, Voxy | Booz &amp; Company Alum</p>\n<p><em>Consulting is something that attracts risk-averse people and makes them more risk averse the longer they spend time there. And in startups you need to thrive on risk. You need to be comfortable with the world changing beneath your feet all of the time. You may start at a company that is focused on x, but if you’re not getting traction, you may say “we’re rebranding, we are now a company doing y.” That takes some getting used to. We are fundamentally changing the way we are thinking every single day, every single month. To a certain extent, BCG trains you well for that, but here you’re living with your decisions and living in a high risk environment.</em></p>\n<p>&#8211; Vatsa Narasimha, EVP, CFO, &amp; Chief Strategy Officer, OANDA | Boston Consulting Group Alum</p>\n<p><strong>Your Background will Benefit You&#8230;</strong></p>\n<p><em>In some ways a startup is similar to BCG – like if a presentation blows up the night before it’s due, everyone, no matter how junior or senior, is going to sit down and split up the work. That mindset is valuable in a startup.</em></p>\n<p>&#8211; Vatsa Narasimha, EVP, CFO, &amp; Chief Strategy Officer, OANDA | Boston Consulting Group Alum</p>\n<p><em>I think consulting firms do a great job at picking people who are obviously great academically out of undergrad, but who are also weirdly wired in college to – with no compensation or real clear reason – choose to be Editor of the school newspaper, or to be head of a bunch of clubs, or start a nonprofit on the side … there’s this compulsion to get things done right and done well.</em></p>\n<p>&#8211; David Snider, COO / CFO, Urban Compass | Bain &amp; Company Alum</p>\n<p><strong>&#8230;But Don&#8217;t Be Overconfident:</strong></p>\n<p><em>A big [pitfall to avoid] is thinking you know all the answers. Consultants are all about structured thinking, but sometimes you can get so fixated on your idea by proving it to yourself a hundred times – in your office, in the shower, etc. – that you can convince yourself you’ve found the absolute right answer. You need to be flexible enough to realize, “Wow, I totally missed this, and now I have to course-correct if I want to stay alive.”</em></p>\n<p>&#8211; Paul Gollash, Founder &amp; CEO, Voxy | Booz &amp; Company Alum</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<hr />\n<p>You know you’ll have a lot of options when you decide to leave consulting. But do you know how to make the right choice? The following clips from our recent interviews shed some light on how to properly evaluate a new opportunity.</p>\n<p><strong>The Criteria:</strong></p>\n<p>Dave Rickard, Vice President, Continuous Improvement for Uline told Raines he weighed three factors &#8212; where, what and how the new opportunity would serve him.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I thought about three things when I looked at where to go next: the firm and the industry, the skills, and the fit,&#8221; Rickard, a Boston Consulting Group Alum says. &#8220;I wanted to join a growing industry leader. Second, I had developed a lot of skills and experiences over my time in consulting, and I wanted to join a firm where that was going to be valued and I would be able to contribute from the get-go.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;And the last was really around fit. I have had the benefit of consulting many different companies and realized there are a lot of different corporate cultures out there,&#8221; Dave explains. &#8220;My style won’t resonate with all of them and I wouldn’t expect it to, so finding the match was quite important.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Chad Lusk, Chief Strategy Officer of Ferrara Candy Company, looked for three keys when leaving McKinsey. Lusk told us:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Number one, did I believe in the investment thesis? Number two, did I see what my individual contributions were going to be and did my particular role fit what I wanted to do? And number three, is the leadership team a collaborative, change-oriented, driven team that could get us to our goal?&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>David Snider, COO/CFO of Urban Compass, <a href=\"http://consultanttrack.com/profiles/david/\">factored </a>in geography, industry and investment when choosing a position after business school.</p>\n<p>Outside of <em>where</em> he wanted to work, Dave, a Bain &amp; Company Alum, focused on finding &#8220;an industry that broadly interested me –not healthcare, and not a bunch of other things. But real estate, financial services, and a couple others I could see myself in.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Dave also wanted to know he would have an impact in a business that had a solid future, and he felt he would be best served if he already knew someone at the company.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Finally, I thought it was important that there was an equity component in some form,&#8221; Dave said. &#8220;No matter what, I wanted to feel a deep personal investment in the success of the business. So I looked at a lot of different options, but tried to keep those criteria in mind. I figured I’d reasonably get four out of six, and the opportunity at Urban Compass was six of six.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>The Big Questions:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>A flexible mindset will expand your opportunity set. The key questions when the opportunity arises are “Is this experience going to stretch and develop my skills?” and “Is this going to be rewarding in terms of the elements that are important to me as an individual?” I would say that generally I am on a global finance path… but there is not really an ideal or fixed path. </em>&#8211; Andrew Townend, CFO, PepsiCo Australia and New Zealand | Boston Consulting Group Alum</p>\n<p>Vatsa Narasimha, EVP, CFO, &amp; Chief Strategy Officer, OANDA, highlights the importance of positive recommendations and advises hiring managers vet potential employees by checking to see how their peers view them.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If I’m a manager at BCG, I don’t take you on to a case without checking with two other managers for whom you’ve worked, to ask how well you work in different settings,&#8221; Vatsa, a BCG alum. &#8220;At the same time, you’d talk to some of the other consultants or associates and ask them, &#8216;Who has worked with Vatsa? How is he as a manager?&#8217; Seems like basic stuff, but when you’re looking for a job, I think people fail to do that.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Look Beyond Money and Team Size:</strong></p>\n<p>Vatsa also recommends consultants take the time to thoroughly review new roles before jumping ship. &#8220;A lot of consultants don’t have time to breathe in consulting, so they take the first offer that comes their way,&#8221; Vatsa says. &#8220;Most people leave because they had one or two bad cases in a row. They aren’t making a conscious, careful decision to leave. They’re all talented people, and then they get offered a job that is going to pay them more, at a pretty good company.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And, even if the pay is great, Vatsa reminds that you have to &#8220;take a step back and really assess what you want,&#8221; instead of being lured for money. &#8220;Don&#8217;t just look at the dollar sign.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Arjun Moorthy, VP, Business Development &amp; Channel Sales, Hubspot, also recommends taking a step back &#8212; in terms of what your role is. &#8220;Don’t be in a rush to become a manager,&#8221; Arjun, a BCG alum, says.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There’s something amazing about being an individual contributor, whether it’s carrying a sales quota or designing a product – you’re the person that’s driving the company,&#8221; Arjun describes. &#8220;You may be driving a small part of it but you’re actually driving it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Instead of being focused on jumping up the food chain, focusing on having control and being invested in the building blocks. &#8220;Management has so much overhead, and they make decisions that steer the company, but they don’t drive it,&#8221; Arjun told us. &#8220;You shouldn’t be in a rush to get to that point. In the last ten years, I, and probably a lot of my peers, have been obsessed with titles and salaries. But really the higher the title and the more the compensation, the further you’ll be from driving the ship. You’ll be in a bureaucratic layer steering it, and I don’t think that’s always fun.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<p class=\"profile-intro\">Position: CFO</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">Current Firm: PepsiCo Australia and New Zealand</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>You started your career at J.P. Morgan in Investment Banking. Did you know going into business school that you wanted to shift into consulting? How would you compare the two environments?</em></p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">When I went to business school, I was really thinking that private equity was where I wanted to go. I figured it would leverage my corporate finance background but get me “into the game” of investing in companies and managing companies operationally. But when I was exposed to consulting, I realized it was the perfect place to get a breadth of strategic and operational casework that would prepare me for the future, whether that future involved private equity, corporate, or something entrepreneurial. I didn’t have a grand plan, but when I was in business school I felt that consulting was the best development experience. And one which would subsequently expand my future options set.</p>\n<p>Banking and consulting are similar in that both involve collaboration with the highest levels of leadership to address and solve big challenges, and both are quite fast-paced. But they are quite different in terms of the learning experience and the culture. Banking allowed me to develop a very deep and narrow focus in corporate finance and M&amp;A transactions, and it helped build important functional skills in valuation, modeling, and managing transactions. Consulting kind of flipped that on its axis. It was a much broader experience, with a periodic spike down into different areas. It offered exposure to different industries as well as different kinds of strategic, organizational, and operational business challenges and opportunities.</p>\n<p>As far as culture, the banking experience required a seven-days-a-week mindset where you really had to pay your dues. In consulting, there was an acknowledgment that you were going to travel and work very hard during the week, but you were going to do your best to protect those weekends. I found that consulting had a better work-life balance and a greater focus on development.</p>\n<p><em>Talk to us about the Sustainability Initiative – a multi-year research collaboration you led with MIT during your time as a Principal at BCG. What was involved, and did the experience provide any upside in terms of differentiation from your class (either in consulting or in interviews)?</em></p>\n<p>The Sustainability Initiative was a unique opportunity to work with world-class organizations on an immensely important topic. It is now a foundational partnership between BCG and MIT, and the objective was to establish an online knowledge hub that would showcase research and create a conversation around the intersection of business and sustainability. We worked to answer the question “What is sustainability?” primarily in terms of its implications for management. That was exciting. And certainly, sustainability is on the C-suite agenda at most large companies.</p>\n<p>It was largely a fully-dedicated project. I had the good fortune of getting some interesting strategy work in renewable energy, so I had worked with our Energy &amp; Environment practice area leaders, as well as our Global Strategy Institute leader. As a result, I was fully dedicated to the project for a period. It was great to partner with a world-class university like MIT and in this case the Sloan Management Review, and to do a project that had a broader management and social impact scope to it.</p>\n<p>It was a particularly great chance to connect with thought leaders and think through the tough challenges of how you balance the short-term and the long-term. And I think it did differentiate my consulting experience and provided a very compelling critical experience to talk about in my interview process.</p>\n<p><em>After 5 years at BCG, you left the firm after one year at the Principal level to join PepsiCo as Senior Director of M&amp;A for their Frito-Lay business. When we called to recruit you, did you know you wanted to leave consulting (were you on transition)? What made you choose that particular role?</em></p>\n<p>Yes, I had already made a conscious choice to leave consulting. I was a Principal in the firm, and while I had enjoyed incredible experiences and development, I didn’t want to be a long-term consultant. I really wanted to get into a managerial role. Raines International actually contacted me on the back end of my transition horizon, which was good timing.</p>\n<p>I chose that particular opportunity not because of the specific role, but because of the career trajectory that was being positioned for me. It was really about the theme of mobility: global mobility, long-term upward mobility, and functional mobility – the chance to work across the finance function in a range of strategic and operational roles. I felt that PepsiCo really offered a compelling differentiated opportunity on the mobility front. And I looked inside the company and found that there were a lot of folks that had backgrounds similar to mine, and I could see myself succeeding in that environment.</p>\n<p><em>When considering external opportunities (and having watched many colleagues move into different roles), some consultants get caught up on the cosmetics of a role rather than the substance (i.e. “I will only look at SVP roles” or “I have to have a team of 5+ people”). Having had a fantastic trajectory at PepsiCo, what do you think are the right questions consultants should ask when weighing their first post-consulting opportunity?</em></p>\n<p>I think the best thing to do is to get testimonials from senior executives in terms of their own careers. And those will differ. Certainly, within PepsiCo, there is no one set pathway. For consultants and bankers who are accustomed to very timeline-oriented, milestone-driven and structured trajectories, it may be difficult to let go of that when you go into large, global organizations. But you can get insight into how the senior executives have spent their time and the critical experiences gained.</p>\n<p>When you look across PepsiCo, you find that no one size fits all. Some CFOs will have followed a very functional path, going through maybe commercial finance and operating finance, and perhaps working in strategy and M&amp;A. Others might have actually done some cross-functional roles, or led big global transformation projects, or had a GM role. I think it’s important to meet with a lot of senior executives when you’re looking at joining a firm so that you can understand the culture and the career opportunities. Get a sense of how they got to where they are, and glean insights into what that might imply for your own career development and career management.</p>\n<p><em>After joining PepsiCo as Senior Director of M&amp;A, you then moved to Switzerland to serve as Senior Director of Strategy and Business Development for PepsiCo Europe. You had studied abroad in Switzerland – had it been part of your plan to return at some point, or at least to take on an international role? How did you get that particular opportunity?</em></p>\n<p>The opportunity broadly to join PepsiCo was presented to me as a Global Finance CFO career path. When I learned about the role, I had a job offer in Australia and was a finalist for another role in the UK, so I made it quite clear that international experience was a top priority. The specific role at PepsiCo happened to be in Dallas where I was located and happened to be in an area of strategy and M&amp;A, which matched my background. And it was imminent in the sense that the person I backfilled was moving on. So they asked that I stay in that role for two years before starting my international career journey and that pretty much worked out according to plan. We then moved the family to Geneva.</p>\n<p><em>Once you got to Switzerland, was there any guarantee of what your next move would be? How have you proactively managed your career? How do you stay on the radar and ensure progression?</em></p>\n<p>There was no well-defined plan, just a general intent to get me into an operating CFO role. To proactively manage your career in a large organization, you have to create both the push and pull. The “push” means developing mentors and sponsors at the senior executive level who will actively champion your career to others so that you have advocates in the room when the annual people planning meetings take place. And you do that by developing relationships and by doing great work with senior leaders, not just your own manager but others.</p>\n<p>You then have to create the “pull,” which means that as opportunities start to present themselves, you need to spend time with those folks and go through the courtship process. For example, the opportunity to move to Australia was unexpected. I was fortunate to have created the push conditions, and the next element was to create the pull conditions through a series of meetings in New York and video conferences in Sydney. I got to know the senior leadership of PepsiCo Australia &amp; New Zealand, as well as some of the regional leadership in our Asia Pacific office in Hong Kong. There isn’t always a well-defined path in a large corporation. You really have to proactively manage it.</p>\n<p><em>Having advised many large corporations as clients, some consultants are very wary of the big companies due to their pace, the layers leading up to the CEO, etc. What advantages do you think there are to starting your post consulting career at a larger corporation?</em></p>\n<p>The great thing about working in a large company is the opportunity to work on both local and global projects, which gives you exposure to a diverse set of experiences and senior leaders. Most consultants who come into a company like PepsiCo do so either at the corporate level or at the strategy level within a business unit. There will be linkages between the corporate level and the other layers of the organization. The way to get into those linkages is by working on large global projects or having an opportunity to raise the visibility of projects that you’re working on with audiences at headquarters – whether that’s New York headquarters or international headquarters like in Geneva or Dubai. Throughout that process, you build relationships and hopefully position yourself favorably in the eyes of senior leaders. There are also global training programs that can help provide visibility. You do have to actively seek that out to a degree, but I think at big companies there is ample opportunity for that.</p>\n<p><em>What is your ideal career path from this point forward?</em></p>\n<p>For me, mobility has been the most important theme. I think you have to look at your career as a series of differentiated critical experiences. When you get to each next step, particularly in a company like PepsiCo, a flexible mindset will expand your opportunity set. The key questions when the opportunity arises are “Is this experience going to stretch and develop my skills?” and “Is this going to be rewarding in terms of the elements that are important to me as an individual?” I would say that generally I am on a global finance path, and would expect to continue to do CFO roles, but there is not really an ideal or fixed path.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p class=\"profile-intro\">Position: Founder and CEO</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">Current Firm: Voxy</p>\n<p><em>Prior to business school, you helped start an import/export business in Chile, followed by helping to launch a new retail business in Madrid for General Motors Europe. Was business school always part of the plan?</em></p>\n<p>I moved to Santiago, Chile when I was 22, and at that point, I just wanted to learn Spanish and experience a new culture. I probably would have done anything (teach English, etc.) but I ended up convincing someone to let me work for free and help him start an import/export business. We imported parts for cars&#8230;it was about the least sexy job you could have, but this guy gave me a chance, and I ended up having this amazing experience. I learned Spanish really quickly – which is honestly probably what inspired me to start a language learning company years later – but he also convinced me that getting sales experience early on in my career was really important. During my time in Chile, I ended up meeting an executive for General Motors while I was trekking through South America, and he offered me a job as a District Sales Manager in Madrid. I was 24 by that point, and it sounded fun to live in Madrid, get an expat assignment, and to continue to learn how to sell. I ended up doing that for three years.</p>\n<p>It was actually between Chile and moving to Spain that I decided I wanted to go back to business school. It wasn’t in my plan when I graduated undergrad (I was a little bit sick of school at the time), but I had just had this very interesting experience in Chile, and knew I was about to go do something else really interesting. I thought it would make a good business school story. Also, at that point in my career, I was incredibly sales-oriented – I was selling container loads of overpriced car parts to people who didn’t speak my native language. I could sell ice to Eskimos, but I wanted to get some of the harder skills that business school offers in the study of finance, analytics, etc.</p>\n<p><em>What drew you into consulting post business school? At Booz &amp; Company, you primarily advised consumer and media clients. Did you seek that out, or was it something that just happened?</em></p>\n<p>I’ve always had a strategy with how I approach my overall career, and at that point, I had already gotten sales experience (to the point where I thought I was too salesy) and had strengthened my analytical skills in business school. Next, I decided that I needed to generalize my industry knowledge because up until then my career had been very industrial with my automotive experience. If I did want to go into media, technology or any other industry, I thought relevant experience would be a hard sell, and that consulting would be a great way to rebrand my industry focus based on which projects I liked best. Throughout my first few projects I managed to befriend a partner in media – so I guess opportunistically I chose media, but strategically I was going for anything but automotive. After a few projects, I was able to curate my own history, so to speak, with a focus on media, pulling from projects with CPG, media, and spirits clients in New York.</p>\n<p><em>You left Booz &amp; Company after three years to join Virgin as a Director of Corporate Development. Were you looking to leave consulting at the time?</em></p>\n<p>When I started at Booz, I was very focused about how this would impact my overall career. Within the first week I had a personal CRM set up and I started cataloging every recruiter who contacted me. I’d get voicemails every Friday and would keep track of who called. I actually started interviewing for jobs at the end of my first year, even though I didn’t want to leave at that point – I wanted to get promoted first, to increase my market value. But I proactively and strategically wanted to develop a network of recruiters to be able to utilize when I did want to leave, and the recruiter who got me my first interview at Virgin was someone I had actually already known for a year and a half through that process. I passed on a lot of lousy jobs before the one at Virgin came along.</p>\n<p><em>What set the opportunity at Virgin apart from others you had looked at?</em></p>\n<p>Truthfully it was getting to work at Virgin itself. I had read Richard Branson’s <i>Losing My Virginity</i> right before business school, and he was, and still is, a hero of mine. So at the time, when an opportunity at Virgin came up, I wanted the job more than anything.</p>\n<p>As for the process, I’d had over 30 interviews with Virgin, and they had stopped returning my recruiter’s calls (I even paid for my own flight and hotel for my last round of interviews). This may not be a lesson for everyone, but when I was told I likely wasn’t getting the job, I called Virgin’s then CEO and said, “I think you’ve made a mistake. I’m perfect for this job.” She gave me an offer an hour later.</p>\n<p><em>At Virgin, you helped conceive, fund, incubate, and launch Virgin Hotels. What was that experience like, and what were some of the largest differences you noticed in your transition from consulting (culture, responsibilities, etc.)? What did you leverage from consulting in your new role?</em></p>\n<p>I was a Principal in Virgin’s Leisure and Hospitality Group, and the structure there was like a private equity or “branded” venture capital firm. One of the first things I was asked to do was look at the hotel industry. We all got in the room Monday morning, and the CEO told me to start thinking about hotels, so I downloaded Marriott’s 10-K and started tearing it apart and building a PowerPoint. And that’s still what I do to date – get smart about something through research, build a story or thesis in PowerPoint, fill in everything I can with data/evidence, and use that to convince people – to buy products, buy equity, take the job offer, etc. Essentially, buy the idea. That’s just my personal sales style (everyone has their own), but it tends to work with Boards of Directors, just like it does with consulting clients, just like it does with teams when you need to convince 40 people that they should all want to do a certain thing in a certain way. So I would say the research skills of consulting translated perfectly into both venture capital and starting a company, as did structured thinking and communication – being able to pull people through a thought and crisply argue and articulate what you want.</p>\n<p>The part that I wasn’t as prepared for was the amount of banker knowledge that was required in that corporate development / venture capital role. Consultants tend to be more focused on the P&amp;L, whereas investors have more of a focus on equity value. I remember in my first couple of months at Virgin during the first deal I was working on, I put a free cash flow multiple on an EBITDA number – which means I was off by 30% in the valuation because it doesn’t account for taxes – and that was because I didn’t have the banking background. So it took me a bit to come up to speed on financial concepts, term sheets, and legal jargon. But now, I find all of that stuff very exciting – figuring out venture math around equity value, what’s going to really drive shareholder value. How things like top line growth, quality of revenue, strategic positioning will translate to more meaningful businesses.</p>\n<p>In terms of the results you need to deliver, consulting and investing are very similar in a sense compared to being an entrepreneur. Here at Voxy, one the scariest days of my life was the day I realized I had to actually go <i>do</i> it all. I was so good at PowerPoint that I raised my first round of capital off of just an idea – so I had $600k in the bank, no tech guy, no product, and no prototype. I had nothing except me and this PowerPoint presentation, and then I quit my job and had to go make it all happen.</p>\n<p><em>At what point in your career did you know that you might want to have your own company some day?</em></p>\n<p>I pretty much always knew I wanted to be an entrepreneur. My dad was an entrepreneur and owned a chain of pharmacies. By the time I was 12, I had started a lawn-mowing business and was typing up brochures and distributing them all over the neighborhood to convince my neighbors to hire me.</p>\n<p><em>You left Virgin in 2010 to start Voxy, a venture-funded learning platform that uses mobile and web technology to teach English to people in developing global markets. How did you get started?</em></p>\n<p>A big part of being an entrepreneur is getting off the starting line and just making things happen…you might flail around a bit, but nothing is more important than forward progress. The critical skill of an entrepreneur is taking that first step because that’s the scariest and the hardest thing to do. It’s also the one that so many intellectuals and bankers and consultants would love to avoid, because why do that when you can think about the problem for a lot longer? But companies don’t get started by just consuming content and reading and analyzing and thinking about the problem, and then thinking through it some more. They aren’t built by just making a PowerPoint presentation. Companies get started by going to LinkedIn, finding a developer, and convincing him or her to leave their job to start writing code for you. Or when you get out and get your prototype in front of users and watch them use it. In the first months of Voxy, I would go out to Sunset Park (a Hispanic neighborhood in Brooklyn) and do paper prototypes with Hispanic immigrants. I would approach people outside of a church on Sunday afternoon and offer them 20 bucks to talk to me. Their ideas became the foundation of my first product.</p>\n<p><em>How did you balance working on Voxy with your full-time jobs at first?</em></p>\n<p>When you first become a consultant, you’re really overwhelmed and it takes you forever to do things correctly. Then you learn how to do everything much better and more efficiently. As I got more efficient in my job, I built in time to do job searching with the same intensity that I would pursue a typical consulting project. You have to keep some of the productivity gains you start to see over time for yourself and your longer-term career goals.</p>\n<p>At Virgin it was the same thing – an intense job with super smart people, working 60+ hours a week. And then in my few hours of free time at home, I would pour over the Rosetta Stone 10-K and do all of the primary research for Voxy, just like I did with the Marriot 10-K at Virgin. I treated Voxy like a long-term consulting project that I did in my free time, every Saturday and Sunday 12 hours a day, and every night of the week. I didn’t go out at night. There’s always overlap, and I think you have to parallel process like that to make transitions smoother. Time allocation is just so important. You should also do something that you’re passionate about. This is not a knock on consultants by any means (many of them are my friends), but most consultants tend to be more intellectually and financially motivated, and those are great things in order to get rich and enjoy thinking…but alone do not lend as much to creating meaningful and long lasting businesses.</p>\n<p><em>Who did you go to for advice when starting Voxy?</em></p>\n<p>I honestly didn&#8217;t really know who to go to at first, but part of being a consultant is being resourceful. One of the projects I did at Booz was for a drill bit manufacturing company, and I had to call all of these oil rig operators to figure out if they liked drill bit Type A or Type B. I would catch them in their pickup trucks driving across Texas and ask them what they thought of the certain type of drill bit, and then I had to piece together all of the information to try to make something cohesive. That’s still what I do today – pick up disparate data where I can. It’s all about being scrappy.</p>\n<p>For example, I found my Chief Education Officer – literally the world’s expert in second language acquisition and an incredible asset to Voxy – through a VC who passed on Voxy in the second round of funding. She was advising them and happened to really like Voxy’s approach. I had already had conversations with 15 or so academics (I had even interviewed the grade school Spanish teacher of one of my friends) and reached out to her. She was clearly the best person I’d ever spoken to about English learning, and it took me two more years to get her, but it was worth it.</p>\n<p><em>Off of that point, how did you select your executive team? What were you looking for specifically as you selected your executive advisers and board members?</em></p>\n<p>Building your team is one of the hardest parts of starting a company, and I’ve tried every idea imaginable to win the war for talent… cold-emails, targeting bloggers using their info@ link on their site, meeting people at events, joining online communities, etc. I got my first two employees that way. My best friend is my co-founder, and he came in at around month eight, and as I mentioned before, it took me two years to recruit my Chief Education Officer, who has a Ph.D. in the subject matter that I needed. You also turn your team a lot in a startup. I’ve had multiple CTOs over the years, and I finally have a Chief Operations Officer who I love – a seasoned operating executive who has built many companies and managed many large teams. He can handle the scaling challenges we have now.</p>\n<p>The other challenge is that in a startup, most people are working for free in the beginning. One of my first investors was Doug Levine who founded Crunch Fitness, and he told me when I started “no one who is as smart as you would ever work for you right now, because what you’re doing is so fundamentally high risk and likely to fail.” I would talk to him at least once a month about the progress and I’d say, “I got this great guy!” And he would say, “No, you didn’t, because if he was that great he would never work with you right now. You don’t have a company name, you don’t even have a product… why on earth would this guy come work for you at this point?” It was a fair point. But after a while, our mission really started to attract people – if there are two billion people that need your product or service, that’s a pretty good place to start. And learning a language is one of the most highly correlated variables to socioeconomic advancement, so that’s a good feeling too.</p>\n<p><em>How instrumental was your Virgin experience to starting Voxy versus having pursued a startup directly out of consulting?</em></p>\n<p>My Virgin experience was hugely impactful. It took more abstract elements, like advice, and the focus on one dimension of business like revenue and cost, and very much expanded my whole way of thinking in terms of larger-picture business and ownership of a company. There were so many venture-capital specific elements I learned, like understanding dilution, shareholder rights, the supply/demand fundamentals of early stage capital markets, how preferred equity can crush the common stock (which is all the Founder has), etc. And that knowledge became my secret weapon when pitching because I knew how to speak the language of the investors. You need that type of differentiation to set yourself apart from just being another smart business person. VC language was my trick, but if you don’t have that, being a programmer or having another unique skill to leverage is important.</p>\n<p><em>You went from a team of one to a team of over 40, including seven people in São Paulo, and you now have $20 million in funding with your round B funding last July. What have been the biggest lessons, and what pitfalls have you experienced?</em></p>\n<p>Being an entrepreneur is mostly about resilience. A lot of smart people that go to top business schools and top consulting firms are generally risk averse. There’s a good Conan O’Brien quote that says, “Success is a lot like a bright white tuxedo. You feel terrific when you get it, but then you’re desperately afraid of getting it dirty, of spoiling it in any way.” At the end of the day you fail so often with a startup. The biggest lesson I’ve learned from Voxy is that I’ve messed up absolutely everything at least once, and I’m still here, because I can either lick my wounds, sit there feeling sorry for myself, or I can get up, realize no one really cares about excuses and try to find another thing that will work. It’s all a huge trial and error and it takes mental fortitude to get through all those errors.</p>\n<p>As far as pitfalls to avoid…there are so many. A big one is thinking you know all the answers. Consultants are all about structured thinking, but sometimes you can get so fixated on your idea by proving it to yourself a hundred times – in your office, in the shower, etc. – that you can convince yourself you’ve found the absolute right answer. You need to be flexible enough to realize, “Wow, I totally missed this, and now I have course-correct if I want to stay alive.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Position: COO/CFO</p>\n<p>Current Firm: Compass</p>\n<p><em class=\"profile-intro\">Going back to the beginning of your career at Bain &amp; Co. and Bain Capital – at a time when many other new consultants fresh out of undergrad are just trying to keep up – you simultaneously co-wrote the very popular Money Makers: Inside the New World of Finance and Business. How did you balance that project along with your day job?</em></p>\n<p>It wasn’t easy, and I think it’s hard to continue a side project if you don’t have momentum. I had started working with Chris Howard (co-author of <i>Money Makers</i>) during the spring semester of my senior year in undergrad, which was made easier by the fact that I was a part-time student and only needed 2 1/2 credits. I then continued writing during the summer before I started at Bain. It was really a Trojan horse, that whole project, to meet and interview such incredibly interesting people. I knew it wouldn’t reflect well on me if I told them I was writing a book and then never actually did it. I was just sitting there thinking “I’ve interviewed David Rubenstein, Julian Robertson, etc….I’ve got to do something, otherwise that’s just embarrassing”. It kept me motivated.</p>\n<p><i>Money Makers</i> was important to me from a personal fulfillment aspect as well. You get to Bain on day one, it is a great place, but all of a sudden, you started to feel a little homogenous in your class. Having something else on the side was important for me. The project gave me great exposure to a whole different set of experiences than I’d had in a more normal professional services firm.</p>\n<p><em>And to get into the details of the day-to-day – so you’re on the client site, and then you’re going home or to your hotel and working on Money Makers from midnight until 3am in the morning, then going back in?</em></p>\n<p>Yeah, a lot of nights and weekends. I was weirdly fortunate at Bain &amp; Company; I didn’t travel a tremendous amount. I spent nine months in the Private Equity Practice, which works hard but doesn’t travel.</p>\n<p><em>Let’s focus on your career path: consulting to private equity, to HBS, and then directly to real estate startup Compass as the company’s Head of Finance and Operations. How much did your work on Money Makers – summarizing six fields driving the economy post-crash, including consulting, PE, investment banking and a few others – influence your career path? Was each of your moves part of a pre-conceived plan?</em></p>\n<p>The original plan was to go into politics. I started working on Capitol Hill, got paid nothing, and everything was contingent upon which party was in power. I quickly decided I didn’t want to start my career there. So once I decided on the business track, I thought I’d do a couple years of consulting, go to business school, and then go try investing.</p>\n<p>So with the move to Bain Capital, a lot of the folks I had talked to said that a) it’s better to try private equity now because even if you don’t love it, you can still go to business school to transition, b) there are a lot more slots for people like you before business school, and c) you then look better for b-school because you’re not just a consultant – you have more of a two-tiered professional background. They’d also say “but listen, you’re in a great place. There’s no urgency. Apply, and if it doesn’t work out, your bets are hedged.”</p>\n<p>For me, private equity recruiting started in March of my first year at Bain &amp; Co., so I’d been there for only seven months – that’s when a lot of these places come knocking. I’m perhaps overly-organized, so I made a little 3 x 3 of sorts: of large cap funds, midsize funds, and smaller startup funds, and of those who are actively seeking consultants, those who seem open to it, and those who did not want you unless you were at Goldman, in TMT, or in whatever Morgan Stanley group. I ended up at Bain Capital New York. I grew up in Boston and had been in a way setting myself up to be there without interruption – but there was the opportunity in Bain Cap’s satellite office in New York, and I decided to take it. I really enjoyed my experiences in the sense that I worked on four deals, which were all very different types of transactions with very bright people, but I knew pretty early on that it wasn’t necessarily the firm at which I wanted to build a career. There was no opportunity cost to b-school in that they kick everyone out after two years to go anyway, which is what I had wanted to do, to begin with, so I took that path and thought I would figure it out from there.</p>\n<p><em>Compass has had great success since you joined the company, raising over $70mn with a valuation of $360mn in under two years. How did you choose that particular opportunity (interest in the real estate market, network, etc.)? What advice would you give consultants aiming to enter the startup scene with success (i.e. what should they look for)?</em></p>\n<p>There was definitely some luck involved. I had six criteria for a post-business school opportunity, and the stage of the company didn’t really matter as much – there were actually some more entrepreneurial investment firms that I thought were potentially interesting whom I spoke with as well. The macro-thesis was believing that I had learned enough stuff in these very well-trodden paths that with the right team around me, hopefully, I could have a positive impact versus filling an open role in a larger established company.</p>\n<p>For criteria, one piece of it was geography: my preference was to come back to New York, though I’d look at things in Boston and San Francisco even if they weren’t my first choice. Second was an industry that broadly interested me – so not healthcare, and not a bunch of other things. But real estate, financial services, and a couple others I could see myself in. Third, and most important functionally, was a role where I would have an impact on a business, and that (fourth) the business had a positive expected trajectory. Fifth was ideally knowing someone in the company because I thought that would be helpful. I didn’t have to know them super well or be best friends with them, but I had a relationship with Robert Reffkin (CEO of Compass, ex-McKinsey) and knew some other folks at the company. Finally, I thought it was important that there was an equity component in some form. No matter what, I wanted to feel a deep personal investment in the success of the business. So I looked at a lot of different options but tried to keep those criteria in mind. I figured I’d reasonably get four out of six, and the opportunity at Compass was six of six.</p>\n<p><em>And just for our own personal knowledge – you were connected with Robert Reffkin (Co-Founder and CEO of Compass) and history was made?</em></p>\n<p>I met Robert at a conference called Renaissance Weekend in 2009 in Charleston. I had been in New York for a bit and wanted to get involved in a nonprofit, ideally education-related. A mutual friend connected me to Robert, who had this idea to start a nonprofit (now America Needs You, <a href=\"http://www.americaneedsyou.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.americaneedsyou.org</a>) that provided professional development support to first-generation college students. I’d been involved in something at Duke trying to help aspiring first-generation college students, and saw that a lot of the ones who got to college had no support and dropped out or had other difficulties. So I had familiarity with that population, and knew actually targeting people in that first year of college, or while making the transition to a four-year college, was a really important time.</p>\n<p>Beyond concept, though, here was this Goldman Sachs guy trying to start this organization all on his own on the side of his day job, and at first, I thought “this thing is going to be a total mess”. But I liked the idea and thought, if he was doing something useful there, I’d be more than happy to help. Fast forward a few months and Robert had hired one of the best nonprofit Directors on the east coast, had Goldman Sachs as a corporate sponsor, had a whole bunch of great mentors and mentees, and a first fundraiser with (then Mayor of Newark) Cory Booker and Howard Marks&#8230;</p>\n<p><em>Yeah, that is very fast for the nonprofit world.</em></p>\n<p>He is very impressive. I made a mental note that Robert was someone I wanted to stay in touch with and hopefully have an opportunity to work at some point. I heard he left Goldman in my second year of business school, reached out, and we chatted for a bit – nothing very substantial, and I never really thought twice about it. And then, in February, he called up and said, “We (Compass) are looking for a Head of Finance and Operations. Would you be interested, and if so can you be here in 24 hours?” And I said, “I am very interested. I will be there in 72 hours.”</p>\n<p><em>So you settled on 48 hours?</em></p>\n<p>Yes – typical Robert. I called up a bunch of friends of mine who were CEOs and CFOs of high-growth tech companies to try and fill in some of the gaps in my knowledge of what I should be doing for those first few months in that role – to institutionalize an idea of growing the company. And then I came to New York. Robert didn’t need to spend much time with me by that point, but I met with Ori (Co-Founder and Chairman) and a few others and got an offer the next day. And at that point, the only thing I was negotiating was the number of days a week Robert wanted me at Compass while I was still trying to finish business school.</p>\n<p><em>Before this interview began, Robert mentioned “90% of my time is spent interviewing and hiring people,” and we know that’s a very large part of your role as well. For consultants looking specifically to get into a startup like this, what can they do to make themselves more attractive for this kind of opportunity?</em></p>\n<p>There’s a big difference in whether or not the members of the leadership team of a company have been consultants, or have been in a professional services firm, and understand how powerful that skill set and training is. There’s an appreciation that there has been a really good selection process in many cases, and also that they got to learn a whole bunch of things that are really useful in tackling problems. Robert and I are both former consultants, so we have a voracious appetite here at Compass for those types of folks.</p>\n<p>I think consulting firms do a great job at picking people who are obviously great academically out of undergrad, but who are also weirdly wired in college to – with no compensation and real clear reason – choose to be Editor of the school newspaper, or to be head of a bunch of clubs, or start a nonprofit on the side. And those are the types of people you want when you’re trying to staff a company. The folks who are here until God knows what time&#8230; I mean, I’m frequently here until very late, so I do actually know what time [laughs]. But there’s this compulsion to get things done right and done well, and any operator of a startup or a business who thinks, “Oh, consultants want to take your watch and tell you what time it is” have really missed the boat on a huge opportunity. It’s an opportunity to bring on board some of the best people from top tier schools who want to work hard, learn a lot, apply themselves and tackle interesting challenges. At Compass, we want people who have natural intellectual curiosity and who are excited to tackle tough problems, because that’s what we need and that’s the opportunity they are presented with here.</p>\n<p><em>And then, given all the positive things consultants, in general, can offer – which we at ConsultantTrack certainly appreciate – we also know that not all consultants, even at the top firms, are created equal. Do you have any thoughts on that, meaning, getting into the real differentiators of OK and stellar consultants? Obviously part of it is swinging at the wrong pitches, which can set cycles in motion.</em></p>\n<p>I should qualify that we at Compass have a big appetite for consultants, but we only want the top 20%. Even in my experience, there were people in my class who were fantastic, and others who are perfectly fine but who wouldn’t be the right fit for the needs we have here. It’s helpful that I know, from my own experience, the type of consultants who I find most impressive. I hired one from McKinsey who was that way, and he’s maintained an incredibly high bar since he joined.</p>\n<p>So the people we have are the best of the group. So what does that mean? That means that when you talk to them, they remember the nuances of the projects they were on, like what were the salient business issues, what was the approach, etc. They talk about it in a structured way to diligence the problem. They speak about it not as a drone, but with an actual interest in those issues and challenges. They know what happened post project rather than just reciting something that is on their resume.</p>\n<p>For example, if it were a private equity diligence deal, this person would want to know whether or not the sponsor they were working for actually got the deal. If not, who did? What happened? Did the company survive? There was a guy who we just interviewed where we dove into a pro bono project he was part of on the policy side of things, and he really understood all the nuances of the policy angles – we then spent 15 minutes talking about what generates business for his firm. That was a great conversation.</p>\n<p><em>Many consultants would kill for your current role as COO/CFO of one of the hottest startups in NYC. What skills have you leaned on from your consulting days specifically to get where you are today, and what others have you had to develop along the way? What single characteristic would you say has most contributed to your success at Compass? Throughout your career?</em></p>\n<p>It’s actually hard when you look back to decipher. A lot of my experiences reinforced each other in a really positive way. So I’ll start with what consulting doesn’t teach that has ultimately been important, and then I’ll answer your question.</p>\n<p>The two things that are most important to success in my job are selling and negotiating. Often they’re one and the same, but as a COO/CFO, it’s also a lot of internal negotiation with people in terms of what they want and what you’re willing to give them, and being okay with being the bad guy as long as there’s a framework and you’re fair about it (Robert loves making me the bad guy) [laughs]. Then there’s the external piece – with vendors and people who we are trying to hire to sell. I’m not actually out selling real estate, but I’m constantly trying to sell the business, whether it’s in meetings with hires like chatting with you guys when I’m talking to developers, or talking to any number of people.</p>\n<p>I’m always trying to help push the business forward. It’s understanding how to identify what someone’s motivations are, or what they’re thinking, and then hitting on the menu of options that in any good business or situation you can pull on – then being reasonable with your negotiating, and helping them understand the framework for why you’re asking for what you’re asking. That’s really important. In this job, where I’m either 100% responsible, or tangentially responsible, for everything that gets done beyond truly building the product or actually selling real-estate, it’s incredibly detail-oriented and very project-focused and managerial.</p>\n<p>So with that said, I think consulting does a good job with setting you on a track of three, six, and nine-month goals. Also, how do you communicate effectively by email? How do you work with teams? How do you encourage teams to do fun events? How do you bridge that gap of creating real bonding versus forced social interaction? Applied to my role today, it’s having to understand how you culturally get stuff right – to think about titles and descriptions and opportunities and bringing in the right people to the &#8220;big&#8221; meeting. All of those particular elements had been carefully thought through and established in the consulting processes, and having hired people who have also been through that process, we all have a real awareness of creating that effect and trying to pull forward.</p>\n<p><em>Speaking to leadership and thinking back to your consulting and PE experiences in hindsight, had you managed in a real and meaningful way before you got to Compass?</em></p>\n<p>No, not really.</p>\n<p><em>So what did you do to prepare yourself, now that you’re on the leadership team and it’s pretty important you not get it wrong?</em></p>\n<p>Well, I started here as a one-man band. I was Head of Finance and Operations, but no one reported to me on Day One besides vendors and our external bookkeepers. I spent a lot of time thinking about the managers who had been effective with me and thinking through what made the other managers and leaders here at Compass great and how I could be complementary to them and the organization.</p>\n<p>Other elements included first informing those I was working with about how they were connecting to the broader goal of the company – why that document, or why something being where it was supposed to be, all really mattered. How their work was being used for the broader goal, and what the feedback was if they weren’t in a particular space. Second, empowering them as much as possible to figure out the right solution, and third, being supportive in any way – whether that’s advocating for them on their team with other executives, giving them resources, writing handwritten notes to everyone on their team defending them for something – whatever that was. And I think the combination of those three things, and having a complementary personality to other senior leaders in the company, has been received well.</p>\n<p><em>Any missteps or anything you recall having done wrong? Whether it’s a people issue or judgment issue or speed issue?</em></p>\n<p>I think the transition from a 15-person startup to a 170-person organization introduces particularly challenging issues in terms of leveling and communication – for people who are not necessarily at the senior level though in some cases were made more senior. It’s challenging in terms of the expectation on communication, information, and awareness of what’s going on. We’ve definitely had some learnings regarding how we communicate and having people feel informed – for example, in more difficult situations, staying positive while also giving people enough to understand what you’re talking about. And by far and away the best book on startup life that I’ve read is sitting on that bookshelf [points] – I bought it for Robert and all the managers who report to me directly – The Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz. You very quickly forget when you move from one small office where you’re sitting in an open floor plan and everyone hears everything, to all of a sudden being in a lot of meetings and calls, that everyone’s still talking just as much, but you just aren’t necessarily sitting next to them and hearing it all. And so making sure you have enough interactions to know what’s going on, over-communicating so anxiety doesn’t set in on stuff – because people want to be positive, but when not given the right access can revert to negative, and that’s self-reinforcing.</p>\n<p><em>So you’re the sitting COO/CFO of one of the hottest startups in New York. What do you like least, and then most, about your role today?</em></p>\n<p>I love the role and I feel very fortunate to have it. I think one of the things people don’t talk that much about, though it’s front and center in the book I referenced, is the amount of constant stress and anxiety that’s there. I actually don’t mind the stress and anxiety around important things, but I have an obsessive compulsive approach in general, and I get frustrated when I have anxiety about things that aren’t actually critical issues. I think it serves the organization well that I obsess as much about the price of the new chairs for our office as I do about really important stuff, though I need to work on it to avoid driving myself crazy.</p>\n<p><em>And like most about your role?</em></p>\n<p>What I like most is the variety and breadth of stuff that I get to handle. I play both roles in a joint COO/CFO position, and combined, it touches every aspect of the organization. I try very hard not to weigh in on things I do not have expertise in unless someone asks, but I usually have a seat at the table on a lot of the things that matter – and that’s not necessarily intrinsic to the role itself. It’s partly just proving value to the original founder and whoever’s leading the organization, and being able to be someone whom they want input from on key decisions. I feel very fortunate for that opportunity.</p>\n<p><em>And going from the major decisions involved with your role to all of the little things, one of the most well-known parts of working at a startup is getting into the weeds with tasks that are not necessarily in your job description. What is the nuttiest hands-on thing that you have found yourself doing?</em></p>\n<p>Most recently, being here at 11am on a Sunday talking to the floor guys as they try for the third time to get the front reception area stain matched correctly (which is still not right) because we had to move a glass wall. That was one of those moments where it’s like, “this is really not a great use of my time” and “no one will notice but me.” But to me, if there is a paper towel on the floor I’ll grab it, pick it up, and put it in the trash. “Operations” is fully vertical.</p>\n<p><em>In reality, only a very small percentage of people can pull off what you have pulled off to date. Meaning, top schooling, top companies and points of accomplishment, and then now a top position at a top startup where things will probably work out pretty well. Coming from a premier consulting firm, some consultants assume they deserve to reach where you are today without the thought, discipline, etc. that has gone into it. Can you comment on the difference?</em></p>\n<p>Yeah, quite the opposite. Even post-Bain &amp; Company, Bain Capital, and Harvard Business School, it’s not as if there were 100 opportunities that were all equally attractive to this one. I would sit in my apartment on campus studying each potential juncture and neurotically / methodically map out the entirety of a space for every opportunity of interest. Who did I know at any possible place? Or, who might I know in order to connect with those people? There is some dumb luck at different stages in terms of which opportunities materialize, but it’s around the cultivation of opportunities that create those things. I was very proactive in trying to go to events, meet people, and stay on their radars in a relevant way. <i>Money Makers</i> was one of the ways I did that. Even now, there are random people I met in college who I still keep up with here – because that’s where the unique opportunities really come from. Now, there are great professional opportunities throughout, and if your aspiration is to be a Partner at an existing firm then you may not need to do all of those things. But since I always knew I wanted to do something different and to be part of building something, it takes a very proactive approach and being open to the unusual opportunities. All that said, I feel very lucky to have ended up here. I don’t think it was just a function of competence in existing roles…those were the table stakes, but I think good fortune and relationship cultivation have been equally critical.</p>\n<p><em>Do you have a favorite interview question that you use in almost all interviews as a quick way to calibrate on somebody?</em></p>\n<p>No is the short answer. It’s important for me to move in a few different directions throughout an interview. I mean, there are certain interviewers, and I’m thinking back to one at Bain &amp; Company in particular, whose style is to try and grill you and make you so uncomfortable that you could never believe that you had a shot at an offer…and clearly, a handful of us who interviewed with that person (and had that same impression) did. I’ve never liked that. At least in my role, I think you transition from being the interviewer to the person who is selling, so in that there’s the art of asking tough questions while still being a colleague in helping them along with those issues.</p>\n<p>As I said, I think it’s important to tack in a few different ways. I do some lighter stuff around interests to make sure they’re personable and can communicate with a bit of banter, and I get a little tougher to see how they’d analytically structure a problem. There’s also the general stuff from what they’ve done, to gauge whether they are “glass half full” type people and if they have a proactive narrative and enough introspection to think about how they ended up sitting in front of me and what that means and why that’s interesting. Ideally, they have some good talking points about why they might want the role and to work at Compass as well.</p>\n<p><em>As the COO/CFO of Compass, and as a normal, rational guy, what is your take on startup perks – the cultural things that are idiosyncratic to the startup world (pizzas, pool tables, wine bars, etc.)? Is there ROI on them? Or is it just something you must suffer because other people enjoy it (and therefore there is some level of ROI)?</em></p>\n<p>I think it depends – there are a whole bunch of different sub-cultures and backgrounds in a company, and we might have more than most at Compass. For the engineers, for example, they have a very focused role with coding day to day, and you want to create an environment where they can have fun because they need a break and a social thing. I understand those distractions because they actually need them to balance doing something so intensely computational for significant periods of time.</p>\n<p>I think the most important thing that gives people overall job satisfaction is the manager for whom they work, wherever they may be. I think, second to that, is being in an environment that feels positive. So yes, you can probably get away with a lot fewer things, but if that second most important criteria behind manager satisfaction is on a relative basis less expensive than 2-3 other HR people who are supposed to go around and help counsel people into thinking things are not so bad – that feels like ROI to me.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<p class=\"profile-intro\">Position: Executive VP, Strategy and Revenue</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">Current Firm: US Foods</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">* At the time of this interview Dave was the Vice President, Continuous Improvement of Uline.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>Many consultants join BCG post-MBA thinking they will spend two years with the firm and then move on to something else. You invested 16 years of your career with BCG. Can you share some thoughts about why you stayed with the firm that long? Did you always have the goal of becoming Partner throughout your tenure at BCG? If not, what elements of your consulting career or experiences put you on the Partner path?</em></p>\n<p>When I joined out of business school I thought I would stay two to five years, so I did not always plan to become a Partner. I think it was a combination of interesting work, the colleagues that I got to work with, and then ultimately developing relationships with some of my clients that kept it very interesting and appealing, so I stayed a lot longer than I initially expected. I did not anticipate that I would develop relationships with my clients, and I wanted to continue to see them succeed, so I wanted to stay with them through the course of their own business cycle.</p>\n<p><em>You received numerous awards at BCG, including the 3i award, which is awarded to a single partner for developing “bright new ideas with quantifiable impact.” In a sea of some of the world’s brightest minds, how does one stand out?</em></p>\n<p>When it comes to innovation, it’s important not to dwell only on theories, but to get practical. That’s typically the area where consultants don’t always shine. You need to get practical and specify what you actually want people to do differently on Monday. I think I was able to adopt that mindset, and that was what stood out.</p>\n<p><em>What would you say are the greatest rewards of the Partner level specifically? How did the role change over the course of 9 years?</em></p>\n<p>Three big rewards come to mind. First, as soon as you make Partner, the learning curve accelerates again. You go from working on one or two engagements at a time to working on many engagements at a time, so the learning environment gets a turbo-charge. Second, the breadth of topics you get to work on is greater. And third, you discover that Partnership is really a global enterprise. You start to have engagements around the world and have colleagues and friends around the world, which is quite special.</p>\n<p>When you first become a Partner, you’re still involved quite heavily in the day-to-day execution of the work. When you’re more senior in the Partner ranks, you get a longer-term view of the overall relationship, and a little bit more focused on finding new opportunities to support the client. So over time, the role continues to broaden.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, you also think about how to help newly-elected partners build their own book of business.</p>\n<p><em>What type of Project Leader or Principal ought to stay on and shoot for the Partner role? What type should not?</em></p>\n<p>It’s a good question. At a high level, there are two things to think about. First, are you enjoying the work? And second, are you successful by a margin, or are you just barely clearing the bars? The bars only get more and more difficult to clear, so if you are just barely making it through each successive promotion, it’s not going to be fun for you.</p>\n<p>In terms of soft skills, it is important to understand that there are always going to be road blocks. The folks who take a step back and say, “I don’t know what to do, but we have three options, and I think we should do option A, and here’s why” have a more empowered perspective than people who throw up their hands and say “I don’t know what to do, I need help.” You may not always be right, but taking the forward steps and saying “this is what I think we should do and here is why” gives you a lot more power over your career.</p>\n<p>It is also important to remember that being a Partner is an incredibly fragmented job. If you want to be singularly focused on one client and one topic, it’s not the job for you.</p>\n<p><em>Of the Principals who shoot for Partner and don’t make it, are there any signs one might see to let him/her know that it isn’t going to be a fit or possibility? Or is a lot of it about being in the right place at the right time?</em></p>\n<p>There is an element of luck by being in the right client engagement, in the right sector, at the right time. But if you encounter people who have moved from sector to sector, client to client, topic to topic…it’s probably a good indication that they aren’t getting enough repeat buyers from the Partner level, which means they aren’t at the top of someone’s queue, which makes it harder for them in the long term.</p>\n<p><em>What were some of the qualities of you and your work that contributed the most to your successful career with BCG?</em></p>\n<p>BCG tends to be very quantitative and analytical, and I was certainly cut from that same mold. But I think what contributed to my success was the ability to take complex or ambiguous ideas and break them down into discrete, understandable parts, either for the teams or for the clients. I was also very much focused on efficiency. “Boiling the ocean” was not my mindset. There are very successful Partners who do love to boil the ocean, but personally, that was not my cup of tea. I preferred to focus on what I believed was the critical question. That sounds simple, but if you’re going to focus rather than boil the ocean, you better have a lot of conviction about where you’re going.</p>\n<p>Along with the pros of being a Partner at a top consulting firm come the rumored cons, including the hours and travel that can make family / life balance difficult. What were the best things about the Partner role, and what were the worst?</p>\n<p>The learning curve and the breadth of topics were very enjoyable. I was able to skim across a lot of different clients and see a lot of different things. And the global focus was particularly interesting. All of your firm-level activities are no longer regional, they’re all global.</p>\n<p>Work-life balance continued to be a challenge. I certainly never worked less as a Partner, though I did have a little more control over that than I did as a Principal. And there were probably times were there is a degree of control that you give up on the day-to-day work – you’re not the one doing the model, you’re not the one making the presentation. You’re empowering your teams to get it all done, but ultimately you’re not in control. That’s a big change from when you were a Principal and the buck stopped with you and you wrote the final deck. So that is a mindset shift that takes some getting used to.</p>\n<p><em>While at BCG, you led the Career Development Committee for the Chicago and Minneapolis offices. What were some of the other firm building and non-client focused things you did that you found most meaningful? Anything that made you a better consultant, Partner, or leader in general?</em></p>\n<p>Just for context, the CDC is the committee that makes all of the recommendations for promotions, and also makes recommendations for training and development of the staff. I was the Chair of that committee. It required about 20% of my time, so it was the vast majority of my work that was not client-facing. Beyond that, I did teach some mentorship classes both to other Partners and to Principals, which I thought was quite valuable but paled in comparison to the amount of effort I needed to put into the CDC.</p>\n<p>I certainly benefited from it for my own professional development. Did it make me better at engaging with clients and from a commercial perspective? No. But it helps me now that I’ve left consulting because I oversaw hundreds of people and had hundreds of difficult conversations about employment.</p>\n<p><em>Are there any extracurriculars you would recommend to younger consultants that would advance their careers / development?</em></p>\n<p>My advice would really be to find some balance in your life. If you want to be a Partner, this is a marathon, not a sprint. You need to find some outlet besides work that gives you some balance and perspective in your life. People who are only devoted to consulting will burn fast, but they’ll burn out. Personally, I’ve always loved running, and I run a couple of marathons a year. So that’s my hobby.</p>\n<p><em>Once you decided to leave BCG, how did you think about what to do next?</em></p>\n<p>When I decided to leave BCG I thought about three things when I looked at where to go next: the firm and the industry, the skills, and the fit. I had a strong desire to join a leading company. There’s no sense joining a number-four player or joining the buggy whip manufacturer right before they go out of business, so I wanted to join a growing industry leader. Second, I had developed a lot of skills and experiences over my time in consulting, and I wanted to join a firm where that was going to be valued and I would be able to contribute from the get-go. And the last was really around fit. I have had the benefit of consulting many different companies and realized there are a lot of different corporate cultures out there. My style won’t resonate with all of them and I wouldn’t expect it to, so finding the match was quite important.</p>\n<p>One of the benefits of leaving at the Partner level is that you have the opportunity to take a little time. So up front I took the time to explore a number of industries, some that I had never consulted in. But where I ultimately ended up was with one of my clients, and a number of the other offers I had were all within the core sector where I had done most of my consulting, which was in the business-to-business environment. So I went out and explored, looked at a lot of different things, and ultimately felt most comfortable where I had spent most of my time.</p>\n<p>I also sought out advice from lots of BCG alumni and McKinsey alumni. It was very much a networking process. Up front I had explored lots of different avenues and sectors that I hadn’t worked in, and the way I got to explore those was through networking conversations, which led to conversations with specific firms. So I probably talked to a hundred different people over the course of the searching process.</p>\n<p><em>How did you evaluate fit? What kind of culture were you looking for specifically?</em></p>\n<p>Fit is an ambiguous term. It’s easier to describe it in terms of the extremes. At one end of the spectrum you have the alpha-male sales-and-trading environment, where they’ll put anyone down to put themselves ahead. I certainly had clients who would fit that description. At the other end you have what I would describe as the overly-paternalistic Midwestern culture that suffers fools for far too long, and I had clients who would fit that description as well. I am based in the Midwest, and I am a Midwesterner by upbringing, so I probably skew to that side of the spectrum in terms of being a little bit more focused on being supportive, but I have a strong competitive streak embedded within that.</p>\n<p><em>What advice would you have for a Partner at a top firm who is thinking about leaving and wondering how to identify and secure the best next opportunity?</em></p>\n<p>I would say go now. When I was on the fence about whether I should stay longer, another BCG alumnus was very blunt with me. He said, “Look, you’ve been a consultant for 16 years. No one has any doubt about your skill set in that vein. Every incremental year you spend in consulting, you’re just getting older and less employable.” Which is pretty harsh, but probably has a lot of truth in it. It’s true I was a little bit more senior, since I was a Partner for nearly a decade, but I think there is never a “right time.” I would encourage folks to take that leap sooner rather than later.</p>\n<p><em>Having recently left BCG for Uline, what skills do you utilize from your time in consulting, specifically from your experience at the Partner level?</em></p>\n<p>My role is very similar to an internal consultant, so a lot of the core skill sets are very similar. A lot of what I did as a Partner was convincing people of my ideas and that they need to grow or change, and I still do that now. Bringing forward a case for change is more challenging in a company that is very successful, given that it’s not as though it’s broken and needs to be fixed.</p>\n<p>The other skill that I think is most important is being able to take other people’s perspective. As a Principal and below, you’re so focused on getting the work done and getting to “the answer” that you don’t spend enough time thinking about the perspective of the person you’re communicating with. The human side of things is probably the element that you don’t appreciate quite as much before the Partner level. Consulting engagements are purchased based on both the core presentation and also trust. And trust comes out of understanding where the other person is coming from.</p>\n<p><em>What was it about your current position that excited you the most?</em></p>\n<p>I think it’s a fantastic company that has a structural competitive advantage that really is going to be a winner in this space and continue to grow quite strongly. I feel very confident in that. Second, the company is now the size of a Fortune 500 company but hasn’t been that way for long, so I am able to bring a set of skills and experiences to bear based on what I’ve seen in my career.</p>\n<p><em>How has it been different “on the inside”?</em></p>\n<p>The client breadth is gone. I have one client now, so to speak. That’s a big change. But the breadth of topics I work on is equally as broad, if not broader. As a consultant, you have a little bit of expertise that you bring to bear but you’re not an expert across everything. When you’re in-house working for a company and you’re one of the senior executives, you’re free to – and expected to – have an opinion or perspective on lots of different elements of the organization.</p>\n<p>Things that are typically handed off from the consultant to the client now don’t get handed off. So I’m spending a lot more time on implementation and actually getting the changes to happen through the IT system, through the organization, through training…that is now a component of my work where it used to be something I would hand off and the client would run with it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<p class=\"profile-intro\">Position: Chief Strategy Officer</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">Current Firm: Ferrara Candy Company</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>You earned a degree in Chemical Engineering and spent 4 years at ExxonMobil Global Services before heading to the University of Chicago to earn your MBA. Did you always know you wanted to go to business school?</em></p>\n<p>From the time I began my engineering degree, I knew I didn’t want to be a practicing engineer. I chose engineering because I wanted to learn how to solve problems. I just figured I’d have to do engineering for a few years before I moved on to what I really wanted to do.</p>\n<p>I chose my first role at ExxonMobil because it was the only company that didn’t offer me a job as a Process Engineer in a plant, or an R&amp;D Specialist in a lab. I didn’t want to be the guy who knew a singular piece of equipment better than anyone else in the world. I wanted to understand the connectivity between how operations worked and how the company made money. Doing sourcing at ExxonMobil helped me learn how a large organization operates and the connectivity among functions. I got to work with a variety of teams including marketing, research &amp; development, supply chain, logistics, manufacturing plants, and our supply partners. Within two years I was managing a billion-dollar purchase portfolio and a team of sourcing specialists located on nearly every continent. By the time I left, I felt I had eked out everything I needed from procurement, which allowed me a good breaking point in terms of going to business school.</p>\n<p><em>Did you know going into business school that you wanted to try consulting? How did your pre-MBA experience at ExxonMobil set you up for success in consulting?</em></p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t know much about consulting before going into business school. While I was at ExxonMobil, we had Booz Allen come in and do a project for us, but my exposure was limited to “here’s a bunch of smart folks with laptops who hang out in a room and pop out every once in a while for a presentation.” So I didn’t really know what was going on behind closed doors, and I didn’t understand it. But as I learned more about consulting, I realized it incorporated all of the aspects that I loved about my job at ExxonMobil, like working with cross-functional teams; focusing on high-value, discrete projects; and developing creative, customized solutions for a client. And it allowed me to do that without much of the bureaucracy associated with a behemoth company like ExxonMobil.</p>\n<p>As far as preparation, my time at ExxonMobil, frankly, gave me the confidence that I could add value and advise professionals with 10, 20, 30 years on me with deeper experience in areas than I&#8217;ll likely ever have in anything. At age 24, I was the youngest in my role in the company and about 20 years under the average age in a culture that respects and rewards years of service. I came out of that trusting my abilities irrespective of age (which helps in a world where as a consultant I was closer to my clients&#8217; kids&#8217; age than their own) and with confidence to recommend a change in environments where conventional wisdom typically prevailed.</p>\n<p><em>You became a member of McKinsey’s North American Travel, Transportation, and Logistics Practice. Did you seek that out, or did it just happen?</em></p>\n<p>It kind of happened by accident. When I joined McKinsey, I told them I wanted to do anything but Energy or Chemicals because that’s where I had already spent time. I was there to learn about different industries, different challenges, and different ways to solve problems. My first full-time study was in Travel, Transportation, and Logistics, or TTL, which I really enjoyed. I did projects in a bunch of other industries but kept getting drawn back to TTL because of the people and the work.</p>\n<p>My specialization ended up being in operational performance transformation for companies with large, fragmented networks. So the key question is how to standardize and elevate performance across a several-hundred-site network while still maintaining individual site independence and buy-in. Those are tough challenges for organizations, and I have carried that experience and those learnings into subsequent roles.</p>\n<p><em>After about four years at McKinsey, you were recruited by Catterton Partners, a Private Equity firm, to drive corporate turnaround and value creation for one of their portfolio companies, Mid-Atlantic Convenience Stores (MACS). Were you looking to leave consulting? What made that a great decision at the time? Were there any other opportunities you considered?</em></p>\n<p>I was not actively looking at the time. I really enjoyed what I was doing, and no external opportunities really generated any interest for me. I told myself when I joined McKinsey that as long as consulting was still challenging, still interesting, and still working for my family, I was going to stay. Meanwhile, the former Managing Director of the McKinsey Midwest Office had become Catterton’s Senior Partner on the operations side of their business. He reached out to me and described the opportunity at MACS, and I realized that Catterton and MACS were scratching an itch that I didn’t even know existed at the time.</p>\n<p>As much as I loved the work, the diversity, and working on things that were on the top 3 of a client CEO’s agenda at McKinsey, I recognized that I was still on the outside looking in, instead of on the front lines of the decision-making. The more I explored the MACS opportunity, the more I realized I was thirsting for the ownership, responsibility, and real-world challenge of owning a P&amp;L and driving decision making from the inside.</p>\n<p><em>Had you ever been involved in a turnaround before? What was that like on a day-to-day basis? Is there anything you wish you had known prior to accepting the role?</em></p>\n<p>I did a lot of performance transformation work at McKinsey, but I had never been part of one from the inside before. The major difference is on the people side. A turnaround involves change and change involves people, and people involve behaviors, feelings, and biases. So managing people, and not just the process, becomes critically important.</p>\n<p>In my role as Chief Strategy Officer, things started out somewhat ambiguously. It was a newly created position, and my job description was basically, “Go help make things better.” On day one, I was given two analysts. Over time, it developed into a robust, in-house strategic analytics team that cascaded across all areas of the business, as well as operational ownership and P&amp;L responsibility of our wholesale fuel distribution business, which was about 80% of the company’s EBITDA. That involved a lot of operational functional areas – everything from field operations and transportation logistics to fuel pricing, sales and business development, and PMO.</p>\n<p>By following a consulting mindset in driving initiatives, I was able to find my way pretty easily and inherit new responsibilities. It was this great opportunity to participate in so many different initiatives across so many different functional areas. Every day was different. That was what drew me to consulting, to begin with, and was perhaps my greatest hesitation in leaving, so I have been glad to find that in my roles since McKinsey.</p>\n<p><em>What would be your advice to consultants being recruited into turnaround situations? How do you know when a company isn’t “turnaround-able”? We’ve seen many people, including former consultants, sign up for a turnaround but leave within a year because it was more precarious than they anticipated or were led to believe. What are the right questions to ask?</em></p>\n<p>As they say, you only have one chance to leave McKinsey, so it has to be the right opportunity. I’m a fairly risk-averse person, so in joining a private equity portfolio company, I was looking for three main things. Number one, did I believe in the investment thesis? Number two, did I see what my individual contributions were going to be, and did my particular role fit what I wanted to do? And number three, is the leadership team a collaborative, change-oriented, driven team that could get us to our goal?</p>\n<p>The benefit that I have had at both MACS and Ferrara is that there are teams of others who have done the due diligence before me. I trust Catterton and trust their information. I’ve described MACS as having all the exciting and fun attributes of a startup without any of the risk profile of a startup. When we came in, we had to build a lot of infrastructure and create stability in the organization. We had to re-staff the organization all the way down to the junior level. We had to build IT and Finance infrastructure. We had to make this company the “big boy” company that it was at $1.5 billion in revenues and 400+ million gallons. But we weren’t starting from scratch. What gave me comfort was that we had strong assets, including an underlying real estate portfolio of over 200 properties and long-term fuel contracts. The health of the business has to be strong with the right fundamentals to generate that kind of step-change performance. That’s what I’m looking for going into these ventures. In different industries that can mean different things, whether it’s product strength or branding or technology or asset advantage, but you’d better believe in the underlying investment thesis, otherwise I would steer clear.</p>\n<p><em>Your efforts at MACS were ultimately successful, and the company was sold to an affiliate of Sunoco after reaching the targeted return on equity in half the time of the original investment estimate. So was it easy?</em></p>\n<p>Far from it. We often talked about our journey in three phases. The first was building stability in the foundation of the business. Under Catterton ownership, this company essentially went from a 30-store family-run business to a 300-store corporate organization and ExxonMobil’s largest customer in the United States. So we had to make sure our foundation was strong, which was a lot of hard work.</p>\n<p>Phase two was establishing our go-to-market approach. We were a disparate set of brands both on the fuel side and convenience store side, and we really had no identity to the consumer. So we came together and crafted a series of standout programs that differentiated us from our competition, including re-branding and a total physical store transformation. We developed a reputation for being different. We took lessons from our competitors and from alternative industries, which is something I was able to bring to the table from consulting. Taking risks to differentiate ourselves was not easy.</p>\n<p>Phase three was about growth. We felt like we had a winning platform, and now we were taking it to store and fuel sales growth. When I joined the company, we didn’t have a sales function. We created a VP of Sales and BD position that reported into me, and with the first two phases in place, we began to gain momentum. My only regret is that we didn’t have a little more time to see the fruits of the labor. We basically put it in place about nine months before the company was sold, and we were getting tremendous traction in that time.</p>\n<p><em>How did your role change once MACS was sold?</em></p>\n<p>Based on the complexities of an acquisition our size, I really had two main responsibilities. First was to continue exactly as we were. As a leadership team, we had an obligation to our employees, our customers, and our partners to communicate and demonstrate that it was business, as usual, going forward. It wasn&#8217;t a hostile takeover so to speak, and Sunoco recognized there was value in continuing to run the business the way we were. Second, I agreed with Sunoco upon a six-month period to help lead various aspects of the integration. That was a challenging time, but we worked to combine the best from both organizations in an activity-based integration. During that time I had the opportunity to launch a more public job search since I was no longer under confidentiality and recognized other opportunities would provide a more dynamic, exciting environment for me at this point in my career.</p>\n<p><em>Since March of 2014, you’ve been Chief Strategy Officer for Ferrara Candy Company, another portfolio company of Catterton Partners. What has it been like to transition from leading strategy for a convenience store operator / retailer to leading strategy for a candy company / manufacturer?</em></p>\n<p>I joke that I simply went upstream, from selling the candy to supplying it. In reality, it’s a different challenge because the functional focus areas are distinct. At MACS it was all about logistics, merchandising, and the customer experience. At Ferrara, it’s about manufacturing and branding. The two companies are similar in size and revenue, but Ferrara is a more complex organization. Our manufacturing and distribution infrastructure spans 9 plants across 3 countries. We’re a full-line manufacturer with many lines of business, including an everyday branded business, a seasonal branded business, with a large private-label component, as well as the supply of co-manufactured products and bulk products. We carry literally dozens of iconic brands in the portfolio. So we’re operating within a much more complex environment.</p>\n<p>The transition for me has been eased by my comfort and familiarity with entering new and different environments and learning very quickly. That’s a trait I learned from consulting. And my kids legitimately love me more now that their dad is “The Candy Man.”</p>\n<p><em>I imagine your office is identical to Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory. True?</em></p>\n<p>Well, it’s not unlike that.</p>\n<p><em>Earlier this year, you spoke at the Chief Strategy Officer Summit in San Francisco on building and positioning high-performing strategy teams. What do you look for as you build your own team?</em></p>\n<p>This topic is very near and dear to my heart given that I’m on the second evolution of building a strategy team from scratch in environments that wouldn’t typically take on a pure strategy function. Building teams from the ground up is all about aligning capabilities within the organization and trying to map those against the organizational needs. I look at three hiring lenses, which I will admit I shamelessly stole from McKinsey: thought leadership, client leadership, and people leadership.</p>\n<p>Thought leadership is your classic problem-solving, analytical and conceptual thinking ability. It is absolutely required in order to be able to deliver against the needs of the organization. However, that means nothing without client leadership and the ability to build trust with your client base internally and getting the rest of the organization on board from point A to point B. And people leadership is important because strategy is very cross-functional in nature. The ability to influence a disparate group of people and be a catalyst for change is extremely critical. When evaluating talent you don’t necessarily need individuals who are A+ players across all 3 dimensions. Each person should have a certain level of competency in all of them, but everyone is going to have their unique spikes. But the overall team needs to deliver against all 3 of those capabilities to ensure long-term impact.</p>\n<p>And then there are a couple of other questions to think about: Do your needs require generalists or specialists? I typically bias toward really smart generalists who can get up the learning curve quickly, versus someone who has done a specific role or performed in a specific industry for the past 10 years. So I typically rank intrinsic skills and competencies over experience and specialization. The second question is, are the needs of the organization structured and defined, or open-ended and ambiguous? In my experience, I have been way more focused on the latter. The teams I’ve built focus on what hasn’t been done or pushed far enough, and the questions that haven’t been asked or fully answered. So comfort with ambiguity in the people you’re hiring is another aspect that I’m always looking for.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p class=\"profile-intro\">Position: CEO</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">Current Firm: Compucom</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">*At the time of this interview Dan was the President and General Manager of Lenovo Latin America.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>Briefly going back to your pre-college days, you spent 4 years in the Israel Defense Forces before entering undergrad. How did that experience contribute to your later career, and what if anything do you leverage from that experience in your role today?</em></p>\n<div class=\"profile-intro\">\n<p>Having the chance to go into the military earlier in my career was quite the opportunity, and a very meaningful experience. You learn to be humble in understanding that you’re part of a larger engine that needs to work together to complete a mission. You’re also able to gain management and leadership experience at a young age, and you learn how to correct yourself quickly. I made a ton of mistakes and a ton of learnings in how to deal with people.</p>\n<p>There’s also the “get it done” mentality. No matter what the reason or challenges, you need to be able to implement and execute. Results talk – not plans or ideas. That lesson was very meaningful to me and has stayed with me up through today.</p>\n<p><em>After 2 years at Monitor prior to business school, and 3 years post MBA at McKinsey, you left McKinsey as a senior Engagement Manager to go into industry as an Executive Director of Strategy at Lenovo. Why did you decide to leave McKinsey (and consulting) when you did, and what was your thought process in choosing that particular role?</em></p>\n<p>My experiences at Monitor and McKinsey were incredibly rewarding. You get to see an unbelievably wide range of businesses and business issues, and you get a ton of knowledge and experience that is impossible to get in other industries or roles. Ultimately, I left McKinsey because I wanted to work for a company that actually made a product. I like products. I like gadgets. I wanted an opportunity in the tech space and thought a strategy group would be the best entry point to leverage my skills. The role at Lenovo also came with a team and afforded me the opportunity to focus on emerging markets and Asia to round out my U.S. and Europe experience from consulting.</p>\n<p><em>As far as we’re concerned at Raines, you’re a poster consultant for how to leverage internal strategy for all it’s worth for a later operating role, going from an Executive Director of Strategy to Vice President to Chief Strategy Officer, to running Lenovo Brazil and then Lenovo Latin America (a ~$3bn business). Was that all part of your plan?</em></p>\n<p>At a very high level, my path was part of a general plan, but in reality things don’t always follow accordingly. I came into a very different strategy department than I exited at Lenovo. I started out under a former McKinsey Director who I had not previously known (a really fantastic individual) and worked with him and the CEO doing what was mostly project based work. I rebuilt the strategy group and built up an M&amp;A function (I had some M&amp;A work at McKinsey). About a year and a half in, there was some change management and both the CEO and my boss transitioned out. By then, I had spent enough time building relationships with the senior team, to the point where they asked me to stay on and work with the new CEO (another one of the original founding team members of the company). From there, I spent the next 5 years working closely with the CEO and the top 10 executives leading the strategy function.</p>\n<p>During those next 5 years, I gained a new lens through which to view strategy. As an Asia-based company, Lenovo has a take on strategy that has much more of an implementation focus to it. Strategic aspiration and intent are nice, but a strategic plan is not complete in the Lenovo world unless it has a very specific organization behind it from an operational viewpoint: a business model with metrics, incentives, and people. It’s not just about finding the answer, but about how you make that answer actionable or impactful – and not impactful in the consulting way, but impactful in the real world way where you implement the strategy and you live with the results. In consulting the big thing is the deadline, whereas in corporate, the timeline is your timeline. It’s a different litmus test in whether you can really bring value to the company and whether you really change the business because you’re (hopefully) going to be there for the long-term.</p>\n<p>Lenovo knew I was interested in running a business, but that I was in no rush out of strategy – I was committed to doing whatever the company needed me to do. I should point out that Brazil was also not the first time I had thought about going into an operational role. Other opportunities that came up just didn’t pan out to be the perfect transition for me. It was a long process, but I knew my first move out of strategy had to be a good fit for what the company needed while also aligning with my skill set. The Brazil role required M&amp;A experience, so I was familiar with some elements of the role before I stepped into it.</p>\n<p><em>So Lenovo knew you wanted to go into an operational role?</em></p>\n<p>Yes – for me, part of my development was taking on a role in the business. You can’t be in too much of a rush to do that, though, which I know is frustrating for overachievers who want to progress every year or every two years to get the next thing. If you trust the people you work with and they see the value in what you do, eventually things work out. With other operational opportunities that had come up earlier on, my value add was still higher in strategy. It’s really important that what you want and what the company needs are aligned. In order to transition, you need a great team in place so that you feel comfortable things won’t fall apart when you leave, and the new role also needs to fit. The Brazil role wasn’t just an operational role – as I mentioned, it required M&amp;A experience, so I could lean on what I already knew while learning the new components. It was a good alignment, and when things align, good things happen. It’s kind of like dating – it usually doesn’t work out very well otherwise.</p>\n<p><em>For consultants wary of internal strategy, how did the experience help you succeed in landing and executing in your role today?</em></p>\n<p>You can’t get anything done in an organization unless you have relationships and support from the different functions. The strategy role is exactly the opportunity to build trust with the senior management team, and to gain an understanding of the organization so that when you come into that operating role, the deck is stacked for you, not against you. My time in strategy was frankly just problem solving. If there was a problem for the CEO or for the President I’d go and figure out what was going on and I’d fix it. If there was a problem that didn’t have an owner or an owner who needed help, or a problem with too many owners, that’s when I would typically get involved. Having a track record of success in that capacity and the trust of senior management really helped in my first operating role.</p>\n<p>There are always exceptions of course, but if you go directly into an operating role from consulting and it’s the first time you’re doing it, you’re also dealing with a new organization, the leadership doesn’t know you, and the other functions don’t know you. It’s going to be pretty rough. If you’ve been an operator in the past, then you know that part of it, but you then spend your time building the relationships. Coming from internal strategy, you’ve spent a few years building the relationships, understanding the business, and helping people and building trust so they end up wanting to help you and work with you. You have a much better chance of being successful.</p>\n<p>Something that is also of note with internal strategy roles is whether companies have a lot of former consultants already. Some of my clients at McKinsey had hordes of former consultants, which perhaps is a bit of an easier situation to walk into because there is a clearer path for you. In comparison, Lenovo didn’t have a lot of ex-consultants, but that in turn allowed me to bring a skill set that had a ton of unique value-add to my organization: solving problems, project management, and thinking through things at a very high intensity and speed. Yang Yuanqing (CEO of Lenovo) is also a big strategy guy, and he’s very visionary – he really drives the company around the strategic plan, so you’re not on the sideline as a strategy person there.</p>\n<p><em>Some consultants use internal strategy as a stepping stone, but few experience the top job as CSO. How do you think the Chief Strategy Officer role specifically affected your skill set and experience versus more junior internal strategy roles?</em></p>\n<p>Being in the top strategy job is a big change because you’re not just taking direction and executing for someone else anymore. You are setting the direction for the company, and you need to have the maturity to do what’s right for the company. In the Chief Strategy Officer role, I needed to understand the businesses, the stakeholders, and the objectives of my boss, the board, and the overall business in order to set the agenda. That’s really a different skill set, and it’s not easy to do well. At McKinsey we used to say “put the CEO hat on,” and as CSO you are literally putting the CEO hat on. If you don’t think like the CEO and you’re just waiting for the CEO to tell you what to, you won’t be Chief Strategy Officer for very long.</p>\n<p><em>You stepped into a turnaround situation in your first non-strategy role as General Manager for Lenovo Brazil. How did you hit the ground running?</em></p>\n<p>In reality, business is pretty simple. You need to buy low and sell high. That’s how business works. The hard thing is getting everything and everyone to work together in order to achieve that result. I was able to be successful because I could quickly assess a problem and identify which levers to pull (the classic consulting skill set), but more importantly, I was able to communicate very effectively to the entire organization and pull people on board in order to execute what was needed. With Brazil specifically, my previously existing relationships from my strategy role allowed me to accomplish some structural changes that would never have been possible otherwise. I could call up all of the senior people and they would take me seriously and understand that I knew where they were coming from, and it helped that I knew how to ask for what I wanted.</p>\n<p><em>As President and General Manager of a ~$3bn business, what do you find most exciting about your role today? What’s next?</em></p>\n<p>I’m actually in transition to a new role now. With my current role, the goal was to get the organization set up, and then to hire a local leadership team to manage it. Running Latin America has been incredibly interesting – I went from focusing on one country with Brazil to 15 countries, 5 sub-regions, and 2 continents. There is such diversity in the countries, cultures, and business challenges there. I made sure to spend time in each country to understand each location’s unique problems, and was also able to bring in a new, higher level lens and operational view to leverage solutions between regions where applicable. The multi-region aspect was great for me, because, in classic consultant fashion, I get bored easily. Having an amazing team made it all the more interesting as well.</p>\n<p><em>Climbing the ranks in an international company, you’ve worked and lived all over the globe: in multiple U.S. cities, Germany, China, Japan, and now Brazil to name a few. Is that something you expected or wanted in your career? How do you think the experiences have helped you overall?</em></p>\n<p>I always assumed I would travel a lot. I’ve worked internationally for over 10 years and traveled internationally every 2 weeks or every month at Lenovo. I guess I didn’t think I would live in Brazil – that was one surprise. But I did, and my son speaks Portuguese now. Luckily I have a very flexible family that is willing to move with me!</p>\n<p><em>You’re heading up a business in a growing company within a historically challenged market. What would you tell consultants who are looking for similar results?</em></p>\n<p>My first boss at Lenovo used to tell me, “Do the right thing for the company and everything else will work out”. At the end of the day, that’s pretty much the rule I’ve lived by. Don’t worry too much about the politics, don’t worry about the other stuff – just focus on doing the right thing and the P&amp;L will speak for itself.</p>\n</div>\n",

      "content": "<p class=\"profile-intro\">Position: EVP, CFO and Chief Strategy Officer</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">Current Firm: OANDA</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>After earning your MBA at Wharton you took a role with BCG. Did you know going into business school that you wanted to work in consulting?</em></p>\n<p>I did not. I went to Wharton to round out my business education. Consulting started to appeal to me mainly because I had never had formal business education before then. My prior degrees were in science and engineering. I realized that if I did consulting, I could learn all of the aspects of a business. I tried it for the summer and thought, “why not do this for two years?”</p>\n<p><em>But you stayed at BCG for 8 years!</em></p>\n<p>Indeed. What I really liked about consulting was that, at its core, it’s about problem-solving, and the problems you’re solving matter. So I was working on problems that mattered, with people I really enjoyed working with, and BCG was a really positive environment with so much learning and camaraderie and mentorship. So all of that came together and I said “okay, I’ll stay here awhile.”</p>\n<p><em>Were you focused on one industry in particular, or were you more of a generalist?</em></p>\n<p>First couple of years, definitely a generalist, and then I slowly migrated on two prongs: one was corporate development/corporate finance, working a lot with CFOs on their problems around shareholder value creation, M&amp;A, due diligences, and all of that stuff. And from an industry perspective, I started focusing on financial services, and over time within financial services I narrowed down to capital markets.</p>\n<p><em>When did you decide you were ready to leave consulting?</em></p>\n<p>I was never actively looking. But I always had this philosophy that, if a recruiter called, I would definitely take the call and have a detailed conversation. I always tell consultants, even if you are very sure BCG is the right place, you should always have your ear to the ground just to see what’s out there so that you know what you’re saying “no” to.</p>\n<div class=\"profile-intro\">\n<p>Consulting was a great opportunity, but I had a very simplistic way of looking at the world of business: you have investors, and on the other side you have operators. Consultants, like lawyers and investment bankers, advise both sides and help solve the biggest problems for investors and operators, and never really have a stake in the game on either side. So I was always thinking, “do I want to get into investing or do I want to get into operations?” And then OANDA came along, and that’s what made my decision. Otherwise I would still be at BCG.</p>\n<p><em>So you decided to leave in 2013 because of this specific opportunity. How did you come across this role?</em></p>\n<p>OANDA was a client of mine, definitely at the smallest end of the spectrum of clients that we deal with. After the project, I kept in touch with the Board and some of the senior management. I talked to them frequently about how things were going in their world, and we were always engaging in discussions about what role I could play at OANDA. I kept thinking that OANDA was one of the most exciting growth strategy projects that I had ever done, and I really fell in love with the company.</p>\n<p>As I evaluated it, I said, “If I want to go over to the operating side, this is a great opportunity. OANDA’s Board is phenomenal, and if I don’t go in with this team, I will not be able to find many other situations as appealing.” I knew there were some issues that needed fixing and that they need to drive growth more aggressively, or they wouldn’t have been recruiting me. But at the same time it felt like I knew what I was getting into. It felt like I was getting into a situation that was backed by people who had had huge successes in the past. These are the people that I wanted to work with for the rest of my career, so it made sense for me to move.</p>\n<p><em>So you felt like you knew what you were getting into?</em></p>\n<p>Well, yes and no. I really went in to be the Head of Strategy. It quickly became clear that there were going to be some major changes in senior management, including a new CEO. The new CEO started in early December, and that’s when I took on the role of CFO. Being a CFO for a financially regulated company is very exciting – it’s a lot of learning, but it also is something that I wasn’t really expecting to be doing. While strategy and corporate development are still under my purview, a lot of my work is focused on establishing the right financial controls, and setting up the company to achieve its future growth objectives. Being a CFO is a new challenge for me, and I had not envisioned that I would be doing that at this stage in my career. So that’s the unexpected piece. It is unexpected, but exciting and enjoyable.</p>\n<p><em>How is your work-life balance?</em></p>\n<p>Some of my friends would probably say I’m working too hard. But I am enjoying it. Someone told me this a year back, and I firmly believe it to be true: “I don’t believe in the concept of work-life balance. You either enjoy work you’re doing or you don’t. If you enjoy the work you’re doing, it doesn’t matter if you think about it 7 days a week. If you’re not enjoying it, you shouldn’t be doing it.” So in this case, I’m really enjoying what I’m doing so it’s always on my mind.</p>\n<p><em>Based on your experience, what are some things you would recommend others do during the interview process to assess an opportunity?</em></p>\n<p>I think the important thing is to understand who is on the team: who are you going to report into. If I’m a manager at BCG, I don’t take you on to a case without checking with two other managers for whom you’ve worked, to ask how well you work in different settings. At the same time, you’d talk to some of the other consultants or associates and ask them, “Who has worked with Vatsa? How is he as a manager?” Seems like basic stuff, but when you’re looking for a job, I think people fail to do that.</p>\n<p>I also think a lot of consultants don’t have time to breathe in consulting, so they take the first offer that comes their way. Most people leave because they had one or two bad cases in a row. They aren’t making a conscious, careful decision to leave. They’re all talented people, and then they get offered a job that is going to pay them more, at a pretty good company. When those companies say “you’re earning x and we’ll pay you 1.5x,” it’s very difficult to say, “I’m going to think about this more.” So take a step back and really assess what you want. Don’t just look at the dollar sign.</p>\n<p><em>What advice would you give to people who want to go into startups?</em></p>\n<p>If you want to work in the startup world, my best recommendation is to get comfortable with experimenting and uncertainty. Startups are fundamentally uncertain. They are always lurching from being the next unicorn to another also-ran, and there are a lot of also-rans. If you find something that excites you in the startup space, be prepared to jump into it, but look before you leap. Do your diligence and make sure you understand how stable the team is, how the investors are thinking about the company, what are the exit plans, et cetera. In this community, just because you worked in one startup and the company didn’t go anywhere, it doesn’t mean everyone will look at you and say “I’m not going to hire them because they were in that company that failed.” Pretty much everyone has been in “that company that failed.” It’s a very different mindset, and it can be very unsettling, including from a financial perspective. You’re going to make less money than what you made at BCG… how comfortable are you with that?</p>\n<p>In some ways a startup is similar to BCG – like if a presentation blows up the night before it’s due, everyone, no matter how junior or senior, is going to sit down and split up the work. That mindset is valuable in a startup. On the other hand, consulting is something that attracts risk-averse people and makes them more risk averse the longer they spend time there. And in startups you need to thrive on risk. You need to be comfortable with the world changing beneath your feet all of the time. You may start at a company that is focused on x, but if you’re not getting traction, you may say “we’re rebranding, we are now a company doing y.” That takes some getting used to.</p>\n<p>We are fundamentally changing the way we are thinking every single day, every single month. To a certain extent, BCG trains you well for that, but here you’re living with your decisions and living in a high-risk environment. It is important to be confident. Yes, a startup might fail, or yes, the first job you take may not work out. The key is to remember that you’re smart, and there is always a demand for smart people. You will land on your feet. And that requires risk-taking and confidence.</p>\n<p><em>So with all of this newfound exposure, has your view of your own career path changed?</em></p>\n<p>It’s so difficult to predict anything. I could have very comfortably stayed at BCG for another 10-15 years and been very happy. Twelve months back, I was sure I was going to help OANDA grow and develop new businesses in new geographies. Now I am both the CFO and the Head of Strategy. It sounds karmic, but my advice is to continue to work hard and be open to an opportunity when it knocks on the door.</p>\n<p><em>So stay open to opportunities and don’t get bogged down by a plan.</em></p>\n<p>Death and taxes, right? How much planning can you really do? Most of my friends have all changed jobs significantly. So all of that leads me to believe that as long as you don’t do things that get you on the cover of the Wall Street Journal for the wrong reasons, you’ll be fine. At least I hope so. Fingers crossed.</p>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Position: VP, Business Dev. and Channel Sales</p>\n<p>Current Firm: Hubspot</p>\n<p><em class=\"profile-intro\">You wrote on your blog that a few years out of undergrad, you were disillusioned in your job, were rejected by several MBA programs, and couldn’t get a response to your job applications. Within a matter of four years you got a job with a startup (IMlogic), an MBA from Stanford University, and a job offer from Boston Consulting Group. How did you pull that off?</em></p>\n<p>I think it was equal parts luck and hard work. I got the job at IMlogic through a lucky break, as a result of networking with friends and family. The opportunity was a little unorthodox at the time. The company had only 8 people in it and no shipping product; back in 2002 it wasn’t so popular to join such startups. It turned out to be a really good decision. The company did really well, and it was a great opportunity to wear a lot of hats, and I worked with great people and learned a lot.</p>\n<p>The CEO of that company is still a friend and a mentor. Having a good mentor made all the difference in the world. He was accomplished, he was humble, he was very bright – I learned a lot from him. When it came time to apply to business school, he was one of my recommendations. I think that really influenced my ability to get into Stanford.</p>\n<p><em>When did you decide you wanted to get into consulting?</em></p>\n<p>I had always been in tech and had gone to school to be an engineer, so I thought it would be really nice to get into different industries and see if there was something I might like more than tech. I thought the idea of strategy consulting sounded cool and prestigious. I should have had better reasons for joining, but nonetheless it was a good experience. However, it ended up not being the thing that I wanted to do for the rest of my life.</p>\n<p>The people who stayed in strategy consulting tended to be people who wanted to be advisors as opposed to operators. It’s sort of the big decision that many people will make in their lives: Are you an operator, or are you an advisor? When I got into consulting I realized I was more of an operator.</p>\n<p><em>After 2 years and a promotion at BCG, a Raines International recruiter called you with an opportunity to be Vice President of Infrastructure for SunGard Availability Services. How did you decide you were ready to leave consulting, and what drew you to that particular role?</em></p>\n<p>They say that after two years in consulting you’ve learned the foundations, and fundamentally I knew I didn’t want to go on to be a Partner. As great as BCG is, if you know you don’t want to be a Partner, you should pull the plug sooner rather than later and move on.</p>\n<p>I had never considered SunGard prior to Raines International contacting me. I was looking at smaller startups, and SunGard is a large, private equity-backed tech company. It was an opportunity to manage the real estate investments for a data center company, as well as build out data centers, so it was a very interesting intersection between finance and engineering. It was a weird combination but simply amazing. To date it remains the best job I’ve ever had and the most fun I’ve ever had.</p>\n<p><em>What did you learn from your role at SunGard?</em></p>\n<p>One of the big things I learned was what it really meant to drive strategy. I did strategy consulting for two years, and while I understood it in the terms we would use at BCG, I didn’t really grasp how hard it is to get it right, even when it seems to make logical sense. And if you get strategy wrong, it is really hard to recover. Sometimes you might even get it right, but your timing with the market is off and that makes all the difference. Strategy is not just spreadsheets and a pat on the back after a series of good meetings. It is a really long-term decision that may cost hundreds of millions of dollars. That was my biggest takeaway from SunGard.</p>\n<p><em>After a few years at SunGard, a connection from IMlogic helped you land a role at HubSpot as Vice President of Business Development and Partner Products. How would you describe your experience at HubSpot?</em></p>\n<p>I’m working with an outstanding team, on an exciting product, in an exciting space. I was part of the senior management team for the first two years, and I think a lot of them are some of the best in the industry. And I’ve finally gotten to learn sales, which is something I’d never done. I want to be a successful all-around operator, and my boss is fond of saying “you either build it or you sell it.” I’ve built things but never sold them before now. I’ve had quota-bearing people report to me, I’ve taken sales coaching, and I’ve done several deals as part of my Business Development responsibilities. While there’s still a ton to master in sales, I now feel more confident in this function.</p>\n<p><em>How would you compare the consulting culture to the private equity environment and to the startup world? How is your work-life balance?</em></p>\n<p>Culturally, the three are very different. I don’t think I really knew what “culture” meant until now. A private-equity backed company is not a cultural fit for me. In most cases, it tends to be a lot of older folks who are skilled at financial engineering and squeezing marginal gains from a company versus innovating on products and solving new problems. While I like finance and operations optimization, I love building products more &#8211; so it wasn’t a great fit. I learned a lot and I don’t regret my time there, but I realize now that it’s not a perfect cultural fit.</p>\n<p>In consulting, I really liked the people and even the work for what it ostensibly purported to accomplish, but I didn’t like the lifestyle. I think it’s unhealthy. I’m married with a kid now and I would never contemplate living that way, no matter how exciting the work is and how good the pay is.</p>\n<p>A startup job is a good gig, I really like it. The downside is that you’re flying by the seat of your pants and doing multiple jobs that you don’t always have experience in. Sometimes there is not a lot of process, or you’re not sure whether the next round of funding will come in, so it can be stressful. At BCG I was stressed about performance, but here I’m stressed about successful outcomes. Is the company going to do well enough to keep going? I never had to think that way at BCG. And even SunGard was such a big company that it would’ve been difficult to really screw it up. In a startup you actually can potentially really screw things up.</p>\n<p>From a lifestyle standpoint, hours are long but not crazy long, and it’s more flexible. My work is always on my mind, but I think that happens to a lot of people regardless of industry. You have to learn to disconnect and recharge. One thing I do is avoid checking anything digital after 9pm. I’m pretty good at taking walks at work away from my desk so that I’m not constantly staring at my screen. I think the workaholic culture isn’t specific to startups, and it takes discipline to set boundaries.</p>\n<p><em>What are the key criteria to determine whether a particular startup will be a great career move? How can one filter out the “bad” opportunities and feel confident that a startup will be a step forward?</em></p>\n<p>Truth be told, I don’t think there’s a great formula on this. If there were, you could just invest in those companies rather than joining them. Frankly, you should just go into a startup expecting it to fail, because that’s actually the most realistic outcome. Then ask yourself, “If this fails, do I still want to do this?” If you’re doing it because you want multi-million dollar outcomes, then you’re delusional because that’s a highly unlikely outcome. If you’re doing it because it’s a great team, the product is interesting, the space is exciting, and you’re going to learn something that you’ve never had a chance to learn before, those are good reasons to do it.</p>\n<p>Once you have all that figured out, pick companies that are backed by good VCs – that’s usually a sign they know what they’re doing. Go with a management team that has been successful at least once before. At least one person on the management team should have experienced an exit. If nobody has seen an exit before, they’ll have to learn everything the hard way, and that’s tiring.</p>\n<p><em>You created a blog, curiousjuice.com, to share some of the career advice you’ve been given over the course of your career thus far. What would you say are the two most important lessons you’ve learned from former bosses?</em></p>\n<p>One piece of advice is, “Don’t be cynical.” It seems really obvious, but it’s really important as a manager or a leader of any kind. You don’t have to be perenially happy and positive, but being cynical can bring people down in ways that you may think is funny, but it’s not.</p>\n<p>The other advice is, “Don’t be in a rush to become a manager.” There’s something amazing about being an individual contributor, whether it’s carrying a sales quota or designing a product – you’re the person that’s driving the company. You may be driving a small part of it but you’re actually driving it. Management has so much overhead, and they make decisions that steer the company, but they don’t drive it. You shouldn’t be in a rush to get to that point. In the last ten years I, and probably a lot of my peers, have been obsessed with titles and salaries. But really the higher the title and the more the compensation, the further you’ll be from driving the ship. You’ll be in a bureaucratic layer steering it, and I don’t think that’s always fun.</p>\n<p>I’ve learned some things through my own experience as well, like understanding the politics of decision-making. Any large group of humans will have politics. That’s just life. It’s not bad, it’s not that people are evil, but you do need to know how to work in it and how to play the game. Anyone that decries that and says “no, I want to work in an environment that is devoid of politics and is a pure meritocracy” is delusional – it doesn’t exist. So that’s one of the more profound things that I’ve learned over the last couple of years.</p>\n<p>On your blog, you say you’ve had the good fortune to work for companies that were devoted to the success of their employees. As current consultants consider roles outside of consulting, how should they evaluate that a company will invest in their success?</p>\n<p>Consulting firms in particular tend to be really good at developing talent, because their primary asset is their people – that’s what they sell. The training at consulting is unbelievably good. It’s the main reason I don’t regret my time at BCG. The training they gave me is the best I’ve ever received. Huge, huge props to them. There are other companies with formal rotation programs and mentor programs, and they don’t just pay lip service to it, they really use it to build leaders. HubSpot’s sales team does really good sales development, for example.</p>\n<p>Look at the company’s website and talk to former and current employees and ask about training. If they just tell you “oh yeah, once a month we have to go to a class,” then you know it’s bogus. But if they say “it’s an intense immersion for the first month, and you have tests and exams and periodic certifications, and you really use the product,” et cetera, then you’ll know the company is committed to training.</p>\n<p><em>What is next for you?</em></p>\n<p>Frankly, I don’t know that my next move is going to be with a company that is super well-funded or with a highly experienced management team. It might be that the company’s mission and product are just so connected to me that I’m like “to hell with it, I really want to do this, I’ll sink five years into this. And as long as it pays at least x, then we won’t be destitute,” and that’s it. And then I’m not really set up for disappointment.</p>\n<p>As far as a long-term plan… I have a completely unrealistic, financially unviable long-term business plan for a startup. So I probably need to make some money before I do it. Another idea is to go back to grad school, maybe teach mathematics at a community college. I know it’s a little trite to say that… it sounds like I’m in Good Will Hunting or something. These are just two ideas. Neither is going to pay well, but it may be fulfilling in other ways.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<hr />\n<p><em>We took the 2001 roster of one of the Big Three consulting firms’ major offices (all Partners through Consultant-level of that year), and did a “then and now” study of the 77 individuals, tracking their different career moves in or out of consulting up through today. With so many factors at play, what conclusions can be made? And how do they apply to your career specifically? Read on for the general overview of the 2001 class today, the 77 career trajectories, and some Raines Perspectives observations re: internal strategy roles, moving into industry at specific tenures, and your general consultant network.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Unsurprisingly, there is a lot of variety. People who left the firm did so in different years and economies and at different points in their respective consulting tenures. Undoubtedly, they also pursued options based on individual motivators toward their own personal career goals (e.g., a GM role running a multibillion-dollar P&amp;L, largest paycheck, reduced travel, specific location, or a “feel good” cause). While we at Rahave an eye for what a stellar career move looks like in a vacuum (hint: it has to do with building blocks and a long-term view over short term gains), you’ll encounter examples where the end goal may not have been the C-Suite. Or perhaps that was and still is the goal, but a large title right out of consulting at a struggling firm lured the person off track. While there are definite limitations to this type of exercise when it comes to drawing sweeping conclusions, we thought this to be an interesting perspective worth sharing as you consider your own class of consultants, and where you might sit in the mix. If one conclusion can be made, it’s that consulting experience alone is no guarantee of a successful “up and to the right” type track. What is your end goal, and how do you plan on getting there?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>OVERVIEW – 2001 CLASS TODAY</h3>\n<p><img class=\"\"

move from consulting to internal strategy:</strong></p>\n<p>While some consultants are whole-hearted strategists and go into internal strategy with the aim of Chief Strategy Officer, the majority plan to use internal strategy as a base from which to transition to functional leadership or line roles. In order to isolate the latter group, we looked at individuals who left consulting (at consultant through Partner level) and went into strategy roles 5 or more years ago, at which point a move to operational or other capacities should have taken place if that was the aim/goal.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Of those who left consulting more than 5 years ago (47), the majority transitioned to corporate via a strategy role (36/47, or 77%).</li>\n<li>Of those 36 individuals who went into internal strategy initially, a little less than half (15/36) have since moved into other functional areas.*</li>\n<li>A few people also left consulting 5 years ago and initially went into a non-strategy role, but later moved into a strategy role (4/47).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/consultanttrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Moved-Into-Initial-Strategy-5+-New-copy.png\" alt=\"Moved Into Initial Strategy 5+ New copy\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>*Note: The number of people who stayed in an internal strategy capacity after 5 or more years could be through choice, or through an inability to get beyond the strategy role. For consultants who want to use internal strategy as a means to a functional leadership or line role, they need to study different opportunities accordingly. Does the company appreciate the consultant skillset? Do they have a history of promoting consultants into line roles?</p>\n<p><strong>On the move out of consulting at the Partner level (versus Principal):</strong></p>\n<p>Senior level consultants are often interested in the different opportunities and trajectories of folks who leave consulting at the Principal versus the Partner level. Some isolated information below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Of those who left consulting at the Partner Level (13), 11 went into initial strategy roles (85%), while the rest went into operational roles.</li>\n<li>Of those who left consulting at the Principal level (17), 11 went into strategy roles (65%), while the rest went into a range of functional areas.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>For Partners and Principals who went into internal strategy 5 or more years ago, have they remained </em><em>in strategy?</em></p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Of the 6 Partners who left for strategy roles more than 5 years ago, all 6 remain in strategy roles today.</li>\n<li>Of the 11 Principals who originally left for internal strategy more than five years ago, 7 went into other functional areas, while 4 remain in strategy.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/consultanttrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Initial-Moves-copy1.png\" alt=\"Initial Moves copy\" /></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3> <img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/consultanttrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Partners-+-Principals-5+-copy1.png\" alt=\"Partners + Principals 5+ copy\" /></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3> <strong>THE TAKEAWAY</strong></h3>\n<p>In comparison to our 2006 MBA study (following 400+ 2006 MBAs who went into the Big Three post business school), this exercise drills into and iterates off of one moment in time in one particular office. The variety of trajectories does not just point to the numerous career paths of consultants in general, but to the range of paths that will be taken by the people you know in your own consulting network. Do you know who the stars in your consulting class are, or will be? Have you kept in touch? Re: the specific observations, current consultants considering a move to industry should note that not all strategy roles are created equal in terms of providing a clear path or opportunity for transition to different functional areas. Consultants at the Principal level aiming for line or functional leadership roles might find comfort in the data for making a move before Partner, versus staying on the Partner path.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
      "excerpt": "<p>We took the 2001 roster of one of the Big Three consulting firms’ major offices (all Partners through Consultant-level of that year), and did a “then and now” study of the 77 individuals, tracking their different career moves in or out of consulting up through today. With so many factors at play, what conclusions can be made? [&hellip;]</p>\n",

      "title": "Compensation: To Tell or Not to Tell?",
      "URL": "https://rainesinternational.wordpress.com/2014/01/05/compensation-to-tell-or-not-to-tell/",
      "short_URL": "http://wp.me/p7C5yw-1ye",
      "content": "<hr />\n<p>Most current and former consultants will eventually consider an executive opportunity, whether that be in a large corporation, a private equity firm, a startup, or elsewhere.  During that interview process, questions will arise about previous experiences, skill set, and&#8230; compensation.</p>\n<p><strong>Compensation comes into play for a few reasons:</strong></p>\n<p>1. Companies (or the executive search firms representing them) want to know at the outset if you are in the general ballpark. No one wants to waste time &#8211; yours, or theirs &#8211; and they need to know if they will be able to make a compelling offer. If not, what&#8217;s the point of continuing?</p>\n<p>2. If an executive recruiter doesn&#8217;t know what you are earning (or presents you to the client even though you are outside the realm of possibility), they have ignored one of their client’s key parameters.</p>\n<p>3. Down the line, your compensation is also required for each company’s intricate internal approval process for offers (some go as far as asking for your W2s, pay stubs, etc.).</p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of offers&#8230;</strong></p>\n<p>A company (or executive recruiter) will not be able to tell you the exact number you would receive at offer stage until… you’re at offer stage. Why? You need to visit a house before you put in an offer to buy it, and similarly, companies need to fall in love with you before they can start crunching numbers.  An (almost certainly) inaccurate number quoted early in the process could lead to incorrect expectations, good or bad, and a potentially missed opportunity on both sides.</p>\n<p><strong>Who should you tell?</strong></p>\n<p>We’re not suggesting you tattoo your compensation on your forehead (we hope you would at least foresee raises in your future). Disclose your compensation to people you trust, and who are instrumental in driving your interview process.  If it’s a recruiter you have known for a few short minutes on the phone, get a sense of their professionalism, firm, connection with the opportunity, and process with the hiring company. The simple fact is the more seasoned executives get, the less often they resist sharing their compensation in an interview process, because they know it comes with the territory.</p>\n<p><strong>If you do decide to withhold your compensation&#8230;</strong></p>\n<p>&#8230;know the risk you run in potentially differentiating yourself from other candidates in the process: withholding your compensation can make you appear like you have something to hide.  <b>If you think you are getting underpaid</b>, you can always frame your compensation in your delivery.

      "content": "<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">With the private equity industry&#8217;s seemingly eternal popularity in the consulting world, it&#8217;s not surprising that droves of consultants will line up for a chance at a PE opportunity. As a follow-up to our post on the differences between Private Equity and Consulting, we’ve highlighted some insights from a few PE operating executives who gave their thoughts on what it takes to succeed in private equity as a consultant, and what you can work on now – even while you&#8217;re still in consulting – to get there.</p>\n<p><b>Advice for &#8220;Career Consultants&#8221; versus Consultants with Industry Experience:</b></p>\n<p><em>“I think going from consulting straight into PE might be a little challenging – especially if it’s into an OpEx type role where you are advising portfolio companies. Ultimately, it would be tough to gain credibility with operating companies if you yourself haven&#8217;t had a &#8216;real job&#8217; – while it&#8217;s a stereotype, you&#8217;ll be limited by that perception. Perception is reality, unfortunately. I think getting corporate leadership experience is the best route into PE, especially if you want to take the path I have.”</em></p>\n<p>&#8211; Brian Slobodow, Operating Executive, Golden Gate Capital | A.T. Kearney Alum</p>\n<p><em>“[As a consultant] see if you can get yourself into the private equity space. You can get credit in a PE situation even if you’re doing strategy – I’ve taught a lot of McKinsey guys on my team who didn’t come ready with everything. The next step would be to jump to an academy company to get a deep spike, or into restructuring which is another good way to demonstrate results.”</em></p>\n<p>&#8211; Maggie, Business Unit President, Portfolio Company | AlixPartners Alum</p>\n<p><em>“A combination of industry experience and consulting experience is pretty powerful. Being personally responsible for an outcome in a non-consulting context (whether that’s P&amp;L responsibility, line management, account management, etc.) is a big strength. If the person has been a career consultant, it’s a bit different. When a private equity operations team is recruiting, they want a fairly senior person – the challenge is that senior people at large consulting firms tend to be more focused on sales. Ideally a consultant who is still on site with the client 2-3 days per week and who has real responsibility for delivering the project is a good fit. Career consultants interviewing for a private equity role should be able to demonstrate day-to-day delivery and implementation accountability for a project while still meeting sales objectives.”</em></p>\n<p>&#8211; Adam Fless, Director, KKR | A.T. Kearney &amp; AlixPartners Alum</p>\n<p><b>Increased focus on results:</b></p>\n<p><em>“It’s rare that you have a former consultant that cannot do the strategy and analysis piece…if you cannot follow through, it can be a limiting factor. As someone with a P&amp;L, the numbers are my responsibility, and if you’re on my team you need to ensure those results are going to show up in my bottom line. For success in transition, the question to ask yourself is: will you have the patience and discipline to proactively follow through on your strategy – to set up the tracking mechanisms, schedule weekly calls, work with the different teams, and drive your own results – or will you need to be asked or reminded to do those things?”</em></p>\n<p>&#8211; Brian Slobodow, Operating Executive, Golden Gate Capital | A.T. Kearney Alum</p>\n<p><em>“For consultants who take the route of going straight into private equity, there is the challenge of being deal savvy… when you’re interviewing with a private equity firm, you have to be able to say, ‘This is what the P&amp;L looked like before I was there, and this is what it was after.’ You need to be able to speak their language.”</em></p>\n<p>&#8211; Maggie, Business Unit President, Portfolio Company | AlixPartners Alum</p>\n<p><b>Self-sufficiency:</b></p>\n<p><em>“[The private equity industry] typically values a senior self-motivator who doesn’t rely on a pyramid of staff to execute, and who has the ability to do raw analysis as well as go into a board meeting, and everything in between. They want someone who is willing to roll up his or her sleeves yet also has the ability to handle management and stakeholders at all levels. A lot of traditional consultants have great skill sets but rely on that pyramid model, which makes it tougher to transition to a much smaller, more focused team like you find in many private equity operations groups.”</em></p>\n<p>&#8211; Adam Fless, Director, KKR | A.T. Kearney &amp; AlixPartners Alum</p>\n<p><strong>A Delicate Balance of Soft Skills:</strong></p>\n<p><em>&#8220;When exploring any role, I always try to be myself. If it’s not a good fit, it won’t be a happy marriage. In getting in the door, I think it helps to be personable and humble yet also confident in your ability – and that’s a delicate balance to strike. Those qualities remain important once you’re there, because when you’re dealing with executives at portfolio companies, you don’t want to be perceived as someone who is coming in with all of the answers. You want to be perceived as smart and capable, yet as a partner who is willing to learn and willing to listen. That combination is key to success in both consulting and private equity, but perhaps even more so in private equity where you are involved with these companies over the course of several years.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&#8211; Adam Fless, Director, KKR | A.T.

      "content": "<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Judgment Day, in the lens of your career, is the day upon which you are called to make a decision on a career-altering or path-defining opportunity. Most strategy consultants face Judgment Day with their first move out of consulting. For most professionals, it is a series of Judgment Days that, together, will define their individual careers.</p>\n<p>With our collective insight as an executive search firm – having watched the good, the bad, and the ugly of 40+ years of Judgment Days past – we’re here to help our candidates on Judgment Day. Once an offer (or multiple offers) hits the table, reality sinks in, and the difficulty of the actual decisions at hand can take many-an-executive by surprise.</p>\n<p>Here are <b>some real scenarios </b>we have seen play out, for better and for worse:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A current Vice President and former top consultant, offered an SVP role at lesser company, for a large increase in compensation.</li>\n<li>A Junior Partner in consulting with an objective to be a CEO, offered a COO role at a couple-billion-dollar company, and then a counteroffer by his consulting firm to be an immediate Partner (with a more sizable and immediate financial incentive).</li>\n<li>A Senior Manager in consulting, offered a Vice President role with a struggling company, as well as a Senior Director role with a great, growing company (but for much less money).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What would you do?  While advice along the lines of “make good decisions” can seem trite, that same advice can be of incredible value in a pressure cooker scenario, when your moral compass threatens to become clouded in the face of difficult, career-altering decisions<b>.</b></p>\n<p><b>Applying sound judgment on Judgment Day will demand the best of you:</b> strength of character, long-term focus, and an almost inhuman ability to look beyond the immediate needs of your next 1-2 years.  In our recent interview with Brian Slobodow, Operating Executive for Golden Gate Capital, he recounted the Judgment Days of current and former consultants he has witnessed (missteps included):</p>\n<p><i>“Far too often I see people get hung up on cash compensation early in their careers – they won’t tolerate anything less than what they are making in consulting or their first few roles, or they’ll only take a 5% reduction, and they reject any opportunity beneath that threshold. That kind of thinking is crazy to me. Your decisions, and the moves you make early on, should be 100% focused on how they build your career and maximize both your experience and exposure.</i></p>\n<p><i>It’s the decisions that come from giving short term gains the priority (versus focusing on the longer term) that will prevent you from opportunities you want when you get to the later stages of your career like where I am today….[people] justified not moving for all sorts of reasons – they wouldn’t have a fancy staff, or they stayed in consulting because it was comfortable for them. And those decisions may have been right for them at the time, but they didn’t focus on building the career, and the story, that’s necessary for the job. You’re not just going to wake up one day and be COO or CEO of a private equity-backed $500mn+ company.”</i></p>\n<p>&#8211; Brian Slobodow, Operating Executive, Golden Gate Capital | A.T. Kearney Alumni</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<p class=\"profile-intro\">Position: Operating Executive</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">Current Firm: Golden Gate Capital</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>Going back to your transition out of consulting, you left A.T. Kearney at Principal level after eight years at the firm to join Johnson &amp; Johnson as a Director of Contract Manufacturing. Why did you decide to leave consulting when you did? Did you ever consider the Partner path?</em></p>\n<p>My primary reason for a change was realizing I didn&#8217;t want to be a Partner. As I got closer to the Principal level in consulting, the emphasis was primarily on selling work, and that wasn&#8217;t my favorite thing in the world to do. I knew that career wise I couldn&#8217;t ultimately be happy with that role.</p>\n<p><em>How did you decide on the opportunity at Johnson &amp; Johnson? What factors did you consider in choosing that particular opportunity?</em></p>\n<p>I was fortunate enough to have had a few clients approach me with job opportunities, and J&amp;J was my final client. The big difference with the Johnson &amp; Johnson role was that it was a line management role with a large budget and professional team – I felt it was important that I avoid &#8220;staff&#8221; roles post consulting so I could work on broader leadership skills.</p>\n<p><em>You hit the ground running post-A.T. <span style=\"line-height:1.7;\">Kearney at Johnson &amp; Johnson: you were promoted to Vice President, North American Strategic Sourcing after a year at the company, and then again one year later to Vice President of Global Supply Chain Integration &amp; Strategy. What advice do you have for consultants seeking a similar impact in their first post consulting role?</span></em></p>\n<p>I was a bit fortunate with everything – right place, right time. J&amp;J was shifting its strategy, and my role in running contract manufacturing led to a broader procurement role, which expanded my supply chain scope. Then we decided to go after the largest acquisition in company history, and I was asked to lead the operations due diligence and integration. I was fortunate to have three very meaningful line roles that challenged me in different ways during my four short years at the company.</p>\n<p>If you’re aiming at operational responsibility, the goal is to get yourself out of a staff role and into a line role where you have portions of a P&amp;L and can develop your management skills, take risks, and drive results. In big corporate, there is a lot of bureaucracy, and there are a lot of long meetings (which I do not miss!). The consultants who have the best transitions figure out how to cut through the bureaucracy, and can quickly navigate to the right job that will give them their ideal or targeted experience.</p>\n<p><em>You then joined Golden Gate Capital as an executive in the company’s operating group. Had it always been your plan to go into private equity post consulting? How did that opportunity transpire?</em></p>\n<p>I barely knew what private equity was before. Even at Johnson &amp; Johnson, my knowledge of PE firms was limited to when those firms bought certain suppliers (and that often meant trouble). My move to Golden Gate Capital came through the referral of a former J&amp;J executive who had gone to be CEO in a different private equity environment. I didn&#8217;t even know that world existed back in 2007!</p>\n<p>My entry into Golden Gate Capital began with leading an operating company within the management team as its Chief Operations Officer. GGC didn&#8217;t then, nor does it now, have a formal operating group structure with dedicated professionals. That is a point worth clarifying to readers, because I think it is commonly misunderstood – there are two different paths for operations in private equity: operating groups at the private equity firm level, and being an executive member (CEO, COO, etc.) of the portfolio company team. In operating groups at the private equity firm level, it’s like consulting on steroids, and you parachute in and out of different companies. In my role, I am fully embedded in the portfolio companies, and I get my paycheck directly from the portfolio companies themselves – there is some “nice-to-have” additional from my affiliation with GGC after that. When asked what I do today, the first thing I tell people is that I am the Chief Operations Officer of a window company.</p>\n<p>I love what I am doing now, and for me, I feel like a role in the other type of private equity operating group would feel too similar to consulting at this point. I’ve gotten my hands dirty once, and I don’t think I can go back. No one path is better than the other, but if you’re targeting PE operating opportunities, you have to figure out what you are going for, because – as I mentioned – not all firms provide both options. Just as all consulting firms are not equal, it’s the same with private equity firms. If you want to do great true strategy work, McKinsey might be best known for that, whereas firms like A.T. Kearney or Booz are better known for their operations work.</p>\n<p><em>What were your biggest surprises from your transition to private equity?</em></p>\n<p>The joke in consulting is that as a recruit, you’re wined and dined and shown only the good things – but once you join your firm, you move from the good side to the “dark side” of consulting, if you will, complete with the long hours and pressure of the “up or out” model. You are welcomed to the “real world” where people are no longer fighting for your good graces. I would say that same phenomenon is even worse in private equity, and usually they don&#8217;t even bother to wine and dine you that much at the start. No matter how rosy a situation is painted for consultants re: private equity, there’s no getting around the fact that you’re generally in very stressful situations – more stressful than what you dealt with in consulting. You have a very short amount of time to produce meaningful results, and you are only measured on those results. In consulting, if you fail, the firm as a whole will likely still survive. Even if a project goes disastrously wrong with a client, the firm as a whole will go on its way with other client engagements (unless you have something along the lines of a large lawsuit, and that’s extremely rare). A private equity firm is a combination of the assets on which you are working, and if you fail, there’s a chance the firm as a whole could fail as well.</p>\n<p>The amount of pressure in private equity came as a surprise to me. Part of that also has to do with the time horizon of your projects, which is shorter in consulting. In consulting, if you’re staffed on something that isn’t going all that well, you know you’ll likely be out in a few months. In private equity, once you’re there, you’re there. In my first COO job under Golden Gate Capital, there was no next client for me – the only way for me to get that next chance was to do really well with the first one.</p>\n<p>This brings me to a second realization, and one I think is important to point out to private equity hopefuls. Private equity is not all high-growth situations, IPOs, and opening up new markets. I had to pay it forward in my first role to really get a chance at the kind of opportunity that embodied those more sought after elements. My timing was not great when I entered my first portfolio company as its Chief Operations Officer. It was 2007, at the brink of the financial meltdown, and 95% of our business was international. We had huge regulatory issues on top of that, and the private equity industry in general was bursting at the seams. I had two choices: to go back to the familiarity of a situation like I had at Johnson &amp; Johnson, or to resolve to give it my best, which was a huge risk on my part. I knew my equity wouldn’t be worth anything, and that it would likely always be under water. Luckily I did the right thing and stayed on, but it took four full years as COO of that company helping to turn it around before I was given that second opportunity.</p>\n<p><em>Should consultants go into private equity for the money?</em></p>\n<p>I have observed that the economics can be very hot and cold. It&#8217;s generally equity-based compensation, so if you end up in the right situation, the returns can be impressive. If you end up in the wrong situation, your equity can be worth nothing. At times, it can be a challenging position, and it can make sense for people in roles like mine to take on additional professional opportunities to up their income. Generally you can make more day-to-day cash doing something else if that is your primary focus.</p>\n<p><em>In your role today, what do you lean on specifically from your time in consulting (if anything)? Having worked in both corporate and private equity post consulting, what key characteristics do you think are necessary to succeed in each environment on top of the typical consultant mindset and skillset?</em></p>\n<p>Project management, the ability to assemble a team quickly, and board level communication are skills I learned in consulting that have all come in handy. For additional characteristics or skills, succinct communication at all levels is absolutely critical – being able to relay key information to your board, as well as motivate the lower parts of the organization. A lot of ex consultants have issues relating to those lower levels. In looking back at my time in private equity, corporate, and consulting, an important difference in each has been the general collection of people with whom I’m working, and being able to adjust accordingly. In consulting, you’re surrounded by exceptionally bright people who have been the best in everything their whole lives. They all have their quirks (we used to joke about the “airport test,” i.e. who you could be stuck in an airport with), but overall you’re used to working with a team of incredibly accomplished individuals. Moving into corporate, you encounter more of a mix of people with different motivations and speeds on your team, and you have to figure out a way to relate to and motivate each individual.</p>\n<p>Being CEO or COO of a private equity-owned portfolio company comes with its own challenges in terms of talent. Unless you’re hiring for the executive suite, you’re not always able to wave the brand flag and use it as leverage the way you can at a Johnson &amp; Johnson. There is also always the “unknown” of whether the private equity company will even be there in a few years, which can make it harder to attract talent in certain areas.</p>\n<p>It’s funny, because you don’t necessarily realize how reliant you become on the individuals that make up your teams. In both environments (corporate and private equity) you need to be able to get the results regardless of the caliber of people you are managing, and you need to be able to adjust your leadership style accordingly. I’ve had a pretty good ride, which I think is in large part because I can do this to a certain extent – not saying I’m perfect at it! But I am working to improve. I’ve watched a lot of former consultants come into each environment and fail, and many times it’s because they cannot make that adjustment to speak to the whole of the people with whom they are working.</p>\n<p>I’ve always had a couple of ex-consultants on my team, and another winning characteristic or skill in the transition has been an EBITDA / ROI mindset – the ability to go as deep into the execution side of things as they would on the strategy and analysis side. You need to trust but verify. A knock against consulting is that we don’t do the implementation: we’ll analyze the data, identify the ability for savings, and formulate the strategy to lead you there – but it’s very rare that we get you those savings ourselves. In corporate or private equity, it’s rare that you have a former consultant that cannot do the strategy and analysis piece, but there is the additional responsibility to see those strategies through and to ensure the intended results materialize. If you cannot follow through, it can be a limiting factor. As someone with a P&amp;L, the numbers are my responsibility, and if you’re on my team you need to ensure those results are going to show up in my bottom line. For success in transition, the question to ask yourself is: will you have the patience and discipline to proactively follow through on your strategy – to set up the tracking mechanisms, schedule weekly calls, work with the different teams, and drive your own results – or will you need to be asked or reminded to do those things?</p>\n<p>Overall, I will say that I think the transition to “big corporate” is easier for a consultant than into private equity.</p>\n<p><em>You bridged private equity and consulting with a stint in corporate – is that something you would suggest? How did your time at Johnson &amp; Johnson help you in your role today (if at all), versus going straight into private equity from consulting?</em></p>\n<p>Yes, I think going from consulting straight into PE might be a little challenging – especially if it’s into an OpEx type role where you are advising portfolio companies. Ultimately, it would be tough to gain credibility with operating companies if you yourself haven&#8217;t had a &#8220;real job&#8221; – while it&#8217;s a stereotype, you&#8217;ll be limited by that perception. Perception is reality, unfortunately. I think getting corporate leadership experience is the best route into PE, especially if you want to take the path I have.</p>\n<p>For me, I couldn’t have gone from consulting straight into the role I have in private equity today – I would have failed pretty badly. My previous experience at Johnson &amp; Johnson is hugely impactful to the success I have had in my current role, and I’m incredibly grateful for the opportunities I had at the company. I learned how to manage a team, and how to manage an organization, which is drastically different than in consulting when your teams are naturally smaller and you’re in an advisory capacity. Coming out of consulting, I found myself in a role with responsibility for a $1bn supply chain, 70 professionals, and subsequently the largest acquisition challenge in the company’s history – kudos to whoever put me in charge of that! (laughs). I am forever grateful. Coming from an advisory background, I suddenly had 70 people going home at night under my watch, looking to me for guidance, and all the while, I might add, likely wondering why the hell I was in charge in the first place. I had to learn the business, and on top of that I had to make up for my lack of credibility from less time in the company / industry through engaging and counseling my team – and that’s hard when there is only one of you. Luckily I had some existing relationships with some key senior leaders, and knew a bit of the culture from my time advising J&amp;J which allowed me some immediate room to maneuver – but it certainly took an adjustment to learn the company and my team to drive results.</p>\n<p>In private equity – in contrast – you’re tested on day 1, and if you don’t succeed and show immediate results, you’re out. You just don’t have that time to adjust. While I thought there was a lot of pressure at Johnson &amp; Johnson, if I failed, I would have had to fail pretty horrendously to get fired from my job if I’m being honest. Your leash in private equity is much shorter – I thought I had a short leash at Johnson &amp; Johnson, but in retrospect it was really medium to long.</p>\n<p><em>Many consultants dream of an executive role in the operations group of a private equity company. How do they make themselves more attractive for these types of roles?</em></p>\n<p>Reputation is your number 1 lever for any job and PE is no different – as I mentioned before, I was referred to Golden Gate Capital by a former J&amp;J executive who became CEO in another PE environment. Do a great job with what you have, and stay networked. PE opportunities are right place, right time. Your initial entry will probably be because you have a specific industry or functional skill that the firm needs right then. In my case, they wanted someone with consumer products and health care operations expertise, and it helped that I had a consulting background because the private equity firm was filled with that type.</p>\n<p><em>You’ve been COO and CEO of management teams for three different portfolio companies in your time at Golden Gate Capital. Knowing each case has its differences, are there any key overarching techniques or methods you use to promote on-the-ground success?</em></p>\n<p>I have worked in three very different industries: health &amp; wellness, industrial minerals, and building products. But I am not there to write reports or provide advice – I am there to run the day-to-day company as COO or CEO. That said, it is like getting a new client in a different industry – just on steroids (like I mentioned previously). You need to be a good listener, ask a lot of questions, avoid being too judgmental, manage with data, set clear goals / priorities, and be very results-oriented. It is always a challenge to build credibility, but ultimately that is when you know it&#8217;s all working.</p>\n<p>Another positive thing I learned in consulting is shortening your learning curve – that has helped me with these transitions.</p>\n<p><em>Having been in consulting, corporate and private equity, do you envision yourself in private equity for the long haul?</em></p>\n<p>I cannot see myself ever going into consulting again – with no disrespect to those who take that route. When my days of full time work are over, I might do some side projects, but they would likely be for mid-sized private equity-backed companies – not the formal management consulting work I came from. That world isn&#8217;t attractive to me anymore for a variety of reasons, and the same goes for big Corporate America (Fortune 100). It is too bureaucratic. After seven years of working in PE environments, I don’t think I could go back the other way. I don&#8217;t feel there will be any shortage of PE opportunities for the rest of my career, and fortunately I feel very well matched with Golden Gate Capital.</p>\n<p><em>Anything else to add?</em></p>\n<p>One point I think is important: don’t worry about compensation. The money will come. Far too often I see people get hung up on cash compensation early in their careers – they won’t tolerate anything less than what they are making in consulting or their first few roles, or they’ll only take a 5% reduction, and they reject any opportunity beneath that threshold. That kind of thinking is crazy to me. Your decisions, and the moves you make early on, should be 100% focused on how they build your career and maximize both your experience and exposure.</p>\n<p>It’s the decisions that come from giving short term gains the priority (versus focusing on the longer term) that will prevent you from opportunities you want when you get to the later stages of your career like where I am today. For example, there are many people who want the type of role I have now, but unfortunately many of them are not prepared or eligible for the role because of decisions they made 5-10 years beforehand. They justified not moving for all sorts of reasons – they wouldn’t have a fancy staff, or they stayed in consulting because it was comfortable for them. And those decisions may have been right for them at the time, but they didn’t focus on building the career, and the story, that’s necessary for the job. You’re not just going to wake up one day and be COO or CEO of a private equity-backed $500mn+ company.</p>\n",

The question of “will I have direct reports?&#8221; remains a make-or-break for some when considering opportunities post-consulting.  But there is another kind of management – often taken for granted – that can be equally critical when building your career and impact on an organization: management through influence.</p>\n<p>The differences between consulting and corporate are vast, and consultants often underestimate the need to “play the game” and cater to the existing processes, structure, and relationships of their new organization to drive their individual agendas.  <strong>Management through influence</strong> – the ability to delicately maneuver a bureaucratic landscape by persuading (rather than directing) others toward action – remains paramount in leveraging the resources, networks, and power of those beyond your direct team, to drive permeating impact that goes well beyond your area of responsibility.</p>\n<p>Reasons you may want to think twice (or at least once) about management through influence:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>It exists in every role, at all levels. </b>In an organization made up of people, teams, and functions, management through influence is of the utmost importance regardless of your level in a company – from CEO down. Mastering this skill, and keeping it a priority, will be as important in your next role, if not more so.</li>\n<li><b>It increases efficiency. </b>Depending on the size and existing processes of the company you join, there can be a lot of steps in between you and what you need to get done. Leaning on people outside of your direct scope can be necessary in cutting the number of hoops you need to jump through, or at least help you jump a little faster.<b></b></li>\n<li><b>It simplifies corporate politics. </b>It’s no secret that corporate landscapes come with politics, and the ability to sensitively maneuver the political scene can be vital in getting support and movement on your key initiatives.<b></b></li>\n<li><b>It promotes sponsorship of ideas. </b>Senior-level buy-in will often be necessary. Being able to tap into the influence of others could be the difference in getting your initiative off the ground. <b></b></li>\n<li><b>It begins immediately. </b>Head count and direct management can develop over time. Managing through influence starts on day 1. As a consultant moving into industry, taking on a team while also trying to build your network (and create a base off of which to manage through influence) can be especially, and in some cases devastatingly, difficult. Functions like internal strategy, which often have leaner teams and do not provide direct management opportunities, depend on cross-functional relationships as a basis upon which most every initiative is achieved. Starting in one of these roles / functions can give you a leg up, by allowing you to learn the business and make relationships with others throughout the rest of the organization that you will need – team or no team – down the line.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Keep in mind,<b> it’s harder to be great at management through influence than it is to be great at direct management</b>. Management through influence cannot be an afterthought. It takes a sustained effort, and if you focus too much on direct management (or are given too much direct management responsibility early on) you might miss out on the opportunity to develop this ability to influence, which is so critical to corporate success. Be sure to give it the attention it deserves.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Exploding job offers are the norm these days, requiring candidates to give an official &#8220;yay&#8221; or &#8220;nay&#8221; decision anywhere from 5 days to 2 weeks after an offer is extended.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">On rare occasions (and we mean <i>extremely</i> rare), a company may give you a 3-week to 2-month time frame for an offer decision – but we don’t suggest you count on this to happen.</p>\n<p>The exploding offer trend makes sense for companies, and can be an indication of how important a role is to an organization.  Realistically, if the opportunity for which you&#8217;re interviewing is one of high-impact, it is not unreasonable for a company to want to know relatively quickly whether or not you’re on board to start making that impact, or if they need to start seeking alternative options.</p>\n<p>Given you’ll likely be faced with an exploding offer at some point in your career, what is the best way to handle one? A few tips below:</p>\n<p><b>Know what’s coming:</b></p>\n<p>The interview process is a fairly predictable chain of events. Given you continue to do well, your first round of interviews will likely be followed by a second, and maybe a third and / or management assessment before you are given an offer. The whole process lasts an average of 4 to 6 weeks for executive roles – some can be slower if scheduling is particularly challenging, and some can be much faster (we&#8217;ve seen certain assignments go to offer within 2-10 days of an initial conversation).  Think ahead and be prepared to make a decision if signs are pointing favorably in your direction, and importantly, <a title=\"how-to-reject-an-offer\" href=\"http://consultanttrack.com/how-to-reject-an-offer-three-golden-rules/\" target=\"_blank\">be open about the key elements you need to cross the finish line throughout the process</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Buying time:</b></p>\n<p>You can buy a few days on a decision if you are traveling or overseas when you get an offer, or if you haven’t received it in writing (note: never resign from your current job until you have the written offer in hand). Understand, though, that if you do buy time, it is not so you can continue interviewing at other firms. If you’re managing multiple processes with companies, alert and update your contact (whether it is a recruiter, hiring manager, HR team member, or connection from your network) throughout the process so they can help the company speed up or slow down to your advantage. In any event, it is highly unlikely that the offering company will extend its decision timeline indefinitely just so you can see other, competing opportunities through.</p>\n<p><b>Note: The offer decision is different than the start date decision. </b>An important distinction – just because a company gives a short and firm deadline for offer decisions does not mean your start date must play out in the same way.  Start date is an item you can negotiate throughout the interview process, because most companies are more interested in whom they’re hiring than whether he / she starts one Monday versus the next. If you have a trip planned, or need some time before you start a new opportunity for other personal reasons, make sure you are upfront with the hiring company throughout your interviews. Many companies can be understanding to bring the right individual on board, but are less likely to show leniency if &#8220;crazy&#8221; requests are made at the very end of the interview process (especially if those surprises come after heated compensation negotiations).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n",

      "content": "<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The opportunity to join a private equity operations team appeals to consultants for many reasons. Two major reasons include the chance to execute strategies through ownership of portfolio companies, and the opportunity to create wealth. And while it’s true that private equity can be a lucrative field, it’s important to remember that a payout is not guaranteed just by being there: the upside is tied to your ability to own and manage your portfolio companies, which is both the reward and risk of the industry.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"> Here we’ve gathered a few insights from former consultants, now private equity executives, on some of the critical differences between consulting and private equity:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"> <b>The Deliverable</b></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">“The main difference is that, in consulting, you refer to companies as ‘clients.’ In PE, we refer to them as ‘our companies.’ It makes a difference in what you do and how you do it. While many management consulting firms will deny it, at the end of the day their product is a recommendation that comes in the form of a PowerPoint presentation. And I’ve done that before. In what I do now, I barely ever use PowerPoint presentations. I’ll get a 6-month project for a company and I have a revenue target – that’s my product.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Jeff Kimbell, Operating Partner, Cerberus Capital Management | Bain alum</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"> <b>The Time Frame</b></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">“In some cases with consulting, you’re on a 4-6 month engagement where you have to focus on immediate execution, and then transition out of the assignment. The duration of the project is much different in private equity, where you’re involved in the ownership group of the company and can put in the time and effort to do a much longer-term project… Though they take more work up front, those longer-term activities might have a bigger reward at the end of the day. Sometimes that’s not an ideal model for consulting because not many clients would have the patience to wait 18 months to see results.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Adam Fless, Director, KKR | AT Kearney &amp; AlixPartners alum</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><b>Accountability</b></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">“We are all shareholders in these companies via KKR, which means we all have an incentive to make these companies successful financially. There is an “eat your own cooking” element to the job that I very much like, because it demands intellectual honesty in the work you do… If we actually deliver value, we benefit because we are shareholders, which makes it directly satisfactory.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Adam Fless, Director, KKR | A.T. Kearney &amp; AlixPartners Alum</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><b>The Payout</b></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">“Money can come from a lot of places. In private equity, if you love the idea of being an owner, the money will come, but if you can’t wake up every morning and feel like it’s your money on the line, then it won’t. I’ve seen a lot of people go into private equity who don’t make any money. You have to start with the right DNA and set of skills to make it successful.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Maggie, Portfolio Company Business Unit President | AlixPartners alum</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\n",

More often than not, these companies are stacked with well-documented challenges, loss of public support, a lack of stability, and doubtless behind-the-scenes complications. They also present the opportunity for incredible success on a personal, professional, and financial level. When considering joining a turnaround, the question you have to ask yourself is: can you stomach (and thrive on) its day-to-day battlegrounds in exchange for the potential upside?</p>\n<p><b>Tough Stuff</b></p>\n<p>Understanding the environment and challenges involved in turnarounds is key before signing on the dotted line to start fighting the good fight.  A turnaround does, after all, have its name for a reason.  As an executive at one of these companies, you have to be willing to make the tough choices that are necessary despite ruffling some feathers. Applying thoughts from Errol Morris&#8217;s documentary <a title=\"New-York-Times-Review-Fog-of-War\" href=\"http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/285691/The-Fog-of-War/overview\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara</em></a>, turnarounds are messy and highly complex, and people can make mistakes in the process – some of which can cost the jobs of hundreds or thousands of others. They present a challenging and occasionally negative environment in which you will have to work day in and day out (a turnaround does not fix itself overnight).</p>\n<p>As an executive search firm, we watch decisions play out in the careers of countless professionals.  <strong>Some food for thought when entertaining a turnaround opportunity:</strong>  if you accept an offer at a turnaround knowing full well it will be a challenging environment, and then leave shortly after because&#8230;it was a challenging environment…what does that say about your decision-making and self-judgment?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">“Don’t be too much of a consultant.”</p>\n<p>That is one of the most common themes former consultants and hiring managers bring up when talking to Raines International about what current consultants can most improve upon in interviews and / or in their transition to corporate.</p>\n<p>Like it or not, overconfidence and an air of superiority are commonly linked with consultants when they interface with the “real world,” both in interviews and their new corporate teams (and remember, this feedback is coming from those who have been there, done that already).</p>\n<p>With many consultants making the move to industry, and interviewing before they get there (in our study of 400+ 2006 MBAs who went into the Big Three alone, 67% have since moved into industry, with 76% leaving after only 1-3 years of post-MBA consulting) we&#8217;ve collected the thoughts of former consultants on the assumptions current consultants make, and how best to navigate the transition process.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><b>On the assumption of corporate talent:</b></p>\n<p>Aneesh Kumar, Booz and Accenture alum, and current Head of Consumer Engagement Strategy of Aetna, tells Raines about the  pitfalls he witnesses when interviewing consultants:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><i>“To be blunt, I think part of it has to do with hubris. Coming from strategy, many consultants presume that corporate &#8216;lifers&#8217; are oblivious to the inefficiencies and inconsistencies of the healthcare industry. They’re not. And it is not for lack of analysis, ability, or effort that the industry still has many of its problems today. </i></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><i>&#8220;Healthcare is incredibly complex, and once you get past the &#8216;lifer&#8217; assumption, you realize how much there is to learn in an industry that is highly regulated and where the financial and societal impact is high. </i></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><i>&#8220;My advice is to<strong> combine your outside knowledge with humility</strong> in order to absorb the vast amount of information from those who know it firsthand.” </i></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><b>On the assumption of a consultant’s own capabilities:</b></p>\n<p>One of our most insightful chats Raines International had about consultants and the interview / transition process was with Russell Jolivet, a Booz alum who went into both executive recruiting and now internal talent acquisition.</p>\n<p>Having worked in a number of industries and companies on their talent teams, including a high-growth PE-backed technology company, a healthcare company, and now SunTrust Bank, he gives his immediate thoughts on consultants and interviews:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><i>“Arrogance is something to be avoided. It is also important not to be too theoretical – consultants don’t always give concrete examples, and they often talk in theory instead of offering examples of results. </i></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><i>&#8220;A consultant is impressive if he can show that he is very capable of thinking on his feet, has good communication skills, and is confident without being arrogant.”</i></p>\n<p>On the transition into corporate itself, Russell says consultants need experience and to prepare for full accountability.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><i>“Especially if consultants are coming from the top firms, they tend to believe that they are prepared to (and entitled to) run a business. I think that’s a misunderstanding. Consultants are strategic problem-solvers, but many lack the experience of ownership. In consulting, you only have a short-lived exposure to your corporate clients. You miss out on that accountability.”</i></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><b>So, how do you steer clear of acting “too much like a consultant”?</b></p>\n<p>First, study up – give the company and industry its due credit, and don’t assume you can immediately “get it” because of your ability to ramp up quickly on your assignments. Knowing the general themes won’t be enough when you’re speaking with the people who work in the industry day-to-day.</p>\n<p>In our interview with Jeremy Muench, SVP of Operations at McKesson, he expands on what he believes was the key to landing a role at GE Healthcare despite his lack of on-the-ground experience in the space:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><i>“Despite my lack of healthcare industry experience, I got my job after Bain by doing my homework. I read every report I could about the industry niche of the job for which I applied. My last interview with the General Manager of GE Healthcare was scheduled for 45 minutes, and we spoke for 2 1/2 hours discussing competitor dynamics, industry trends, the profit pool, etc. I got a job offer that evening, and the same phenomenon happened during my interview with McKesson. Knowledge is power.”</i></p>\n<p>Other ways to battle the consultant-stigma? Be humble. Be nice. Treat the opportunity seriously and don&#8217;t focus on them selling you on the role. If the interview ends and they&#8217;ve sold you, but you haven&#8217;t sold them, then you lost.  And we see this happen all the time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Position: Director</p>\n<p>Current Firm: KKR Capstone</p>\n<p><em>You spent your pre-MBA career at A.T. Kearney, leaving after almost two years to earn your MBA at London Business School. What prompted you to pursue your MBA at that point, rather than later (or never)?</em></p>\n<p>I realized that the earlier I left for my MBA, the lower the income I would be giving up for the time it took to complete it. Pursuing my MBA relatively early allowed me to minimize the cost of not working. Additionally, I really enjoyed the academic environment. Even when I joined A.T. Kearney, I had been considering staying in school to earn a Masters or PhD in Economics, so by the time I left for business school, I was looking forward to getting back into that atmosphere.</p>\n<p><em>After business school you made the decision to return to A.T. Kearney. Did you know going into business school that you wanted to continue to work in consulting?</em></p>\n<p>When I went to business school I wasn’t sure that I wanted to continue working in consulting. I planned to use that time to reaffirm my commitment, and I was certainly open-minded to trying new things. I explored some other options via clubs and information sessions, then did a summer internship with an entrepreneurial start-up that involved a bit of work in the UK and a bit of work in South Africa which was a great experience I could hardly have created on my own.</p>\n<p>Then, at the end of my first year, Enron imploded and the tech bubble burst, making the recruitment situation pretty dire. Additionally, A.T. Kearney had sponsored my MBA so it was logical to return to the firm.</p>\n<p><em>After another year with A.T. Kearney, you took a role with AlixPartners. What was it about AlixPartners that appealed to you?</em></p>\n<p>After another year at A.T. Kearney I began to feel the need for change. I was too comfortable and not finding enough new challenges. That’s when I moved to AlixPartners. At that point, AlixPartners was a small, growing, boutique firm. They focused on more urgent situations. They did bankruptcy work, but even their non-bankruptcy work usually involved an imperative need for change as opposed to longer term projects.</p>\n<p>While A.T. Kearney had large project teams and a traditional pyramid team structure, AlixPartners used smaller, more senior teams. Smaller teams meant more individual responsibility. Since you might only have one Associate shared among a few Directors, it meant doing more of your own work, at all levels. It came with a lot of latitude to manage yourself, manage your own team, and work more directly with the client’s management team. In short, it was more “hands on” in every way.</p>\n<p><em>You spent nearly seven years at AlixPartners, leaving as a Director in 2010 to join KKR as a specialist in Direct Materials Procurement – a transition many consultants find very attractive. What do you think elevated your career experience prior to KKR so that you stood out from everyone else who wanted your job?</em></p>\n<p>I think the unique model of AlixPartners meshed pretty well with what the private equity industry looks for. They typically value a senior self-motivator who doesn’t rely on a pyramid of staff to execute, and who has the ability to do raw analysis as well as go into a board meeting, and everything in between. They want someone who is willing to roll up his or her sleeves yet also has the ability to handle management and stakeholders at all levels. A lot of traditional consultants have great skill sets but rely on that pyramid model, which makes it tougher to transition to a much smaller, more focused team like you find in many private equity operations groups.</p>\n<p><em>What does a consultant need on his resume to make him a more appealing candidate for a private equity role?</em></p>\n<p>A combination of industry experience and consulting experience is pretty powerful. Being personally responsible for an outcome in a non-consulting context (whether that’s P&amp;L responsibility, line management, account management, etc.) is a big strength.</p>\n<p>If the person has been a career consultant, it’s a bit different. When a private equity operations team is recruiting, they want a fairly senior person – the challenge is that senior people at large consulting firms tend to be more focused on sales. Ideally a consultant who is still on site with the client 2-3 days per week and who has real responsibility for delivering the project is a good fit. Career consultants interviewing for a private equity role should be able to demonstrate day-to-day delivery and implementation accountability for a project while still meeting sales objectives.</p>\n<p><em>What skills or qualities were the most important to get your private equity role, and which ones became important once you were there?</em></p>\n<p>When exploring any role, I always try to be myself. If it’s not a good fit, it won’t be a happy marriage. In getting in the door, I think it helps to be personable and humble yet also confident in your ability – and that’s a delicate balance to strike. Those qualities remain important once you’re there, because when you’re dealing with executives at portfolio companies, you don’t want to be perceived as someone who is coming in with all of the answers. You want to be perceived as smart and capable, yet as a partner who is willing to learn and willing to listen. That combination is key to success in both consulting and private equity, but perhaps even more so in private equity where you are involved with these companies over the course of several years.</p>\n<p><em>Some of our readers will want to know – how is your job different from consulting? Can you give an example of a client impact you have made with KKR that is different than what you would have done at AlixPartners or A.T. Kearney?</em></p>\n<p>In some cases with consulting, you’re on a 4-6 month engagement where you have to focus on immediate execution, and then transition out of the assignment. The duration of the project is much different in private equity, where you’re involved in the ownership group of the company and can put in the time and effort to do a much longer-term project.</p>\n<p>As an example, there was one project where we started off with some procurement work – typical strategic sourcing, requests for quotations – and we completed that. But in the course of that work we identified an opportunity to do what we call “value engineering,” which is working with the engineers to redesign product specifications, and actually take cost out of the design of the product itself. This is a slower process that takes 12-18 months (depending on the market and the company) before you start to see results, and that’s where it can become different from consulting. We were dealing with supplier workshops and competitor product analysis. We had to really understand the cost makeup of the product, and then do engineering and testing work to look at alternatives. And then if the products were successful, we piloted them in the market and rolled them out.</p>\n<p>Though they take more work up front, those longer-term activities might have a bigger reward at the end of the day. Sometimes that’s not an ideal model for consulting because not many clients would have the patience to wait 18 months to see results.</p>\n<p><em>What is the most common misconception that PE hopefuls have about the industry?</em></p>\n<p>There is a perception that you can walk into a company and just do what you think needs to be done on your own accord. That isn’t the case. Our portfolio management teams run the companies, and when we think there is an opportunity, we work very much in partnership with the management team. No person is an island, even in a private equity context, and you still need to fully involve and align the management team with what you think might need to be done. It has to become a collaborative effort. You need to build a partnership, build a business case, and communicate continuously.</p>\n<p><em>What have been the greatest positives of your PE career?</em></p>\n<p>I like being part of a small team. Even though it’s part of a large company in terms of financials, KKR Capstone itself is around 50 people globally &#8211; our team in Menlo Park is a fraction of that. It also feels good to plan, build and eventually see the positive impact on the portfolio companies.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the greatest positive of private equity is seeing and sharing in the success you have created. We are all shareholders in these companies via KKR, which means we all have an incentive to make these companies successful financially. There is an “eat your own cooking” element to the job that I very much like, because it demands intellectual honesty in the work you do. Making it look like you delivered value isn’t going to help anybody, including yourself. If we actually deliver value, we benefit because we are shareholders, which makes it directly satisfactory.</p>\n<p><em>Do you see yourself staying in private equity for the long haul?</em></p>\n<p>I am never sure what “long haul” is! I’m in my third year at KKR and I don’t see that changing anytime soon. I still have a lot to do. There are exciting things happening in the portfolio that make me feel like there is a lot of room to grow, both in what I’m doing personally and in what we’re doing as a team and as a firm. I like the direction the firm is going, so I feel that as much as you can say in the world today, I have a long runway ahead of me here.</p>\n",

      "content": "<hr />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The move to internal strategy from consulting is the dominant transition for consultants when entering the corporate world, and that makes perfect sense to us at Raines International.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This move leverages the skills that make consultants most valuable to a company, while allowing for an adjustment to all of those other (and usually less pondered) environmental factors that come with the internal workings of a business – setting a base off which to go into different functions and businesses down the line.</p>\n<p>So before you decide that nothing of substance separates internal strategy and consulting, or for consultants moving into corporate in a strategy capacity, we’ve gathered some collective insight from former consultants who have since moved into industry that highlight the not-so-small differences between consulting and internal strategy roles (and corporate in general).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Focus</strong></p>\n<p><em>“It’s a rare consultant who is going to be an immediate success in the operating world. It takes an adjustment. You have to roll up your sleeves more in corporate, and it’s not always as intellectually stimulating as the CEO-level issues that consultants are used to working with (though it is equally as rewarding in other ways). Sometimes it’s about the day-to-day and more tactical work, which, by virtue of the type of work they do, is something consultants often skip past. You have to get comfortable dealing with challenges that will have more immediate – though not as high-level – impact, and with people who may be directly / immediately affected and with whom you’ll need to continue working.</em></p>\n<p><em>The combination of understanding the smaller challenges along with the grand, overarching strategy will enable you to take apart the abstract and make it personal to each person involved. That is the key to successful execution. Once you prove you can execute, you’ve earned your stripes and then you can get a real seat at the table.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&#8211; Peter Bailey, CEO, LABVANTAGE Solutions | McKinsey alum</p>\n<p><strong>Ownership / Accountability </strong></p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Once you’re in [corporate], your recommendations do not stop at the PowerPoint presentation – you are around for the implementation stage (or lack thereof!). Your value to the company becomes tied to whether your recommendations are actually put into action, so you have to be incredibly sensitive to whether your proposals can really work, and make sure you gain buy-in from senior leaders in the beginning as well as throughout the process.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&#8211; Aneesh Kumar, Head of Consumer Engagement Strategy, Aetna  | Accenture/Booz &amp; Co alum</p>\n<p><strong>Resources </strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>&#8220;Internal company strategy groups are not training grounds – you’re expected to have the required skill sets and to work independently. You may also not have the same research resources readily available to you, and will have to find them and argue to fund them (e.g. report access). Unlike large, top-tier consulting firms, internal strategy groups don’t have research departments at their disposal.</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Importantly, you’ll be expected to do more with less, as corporate strategy groups are often small. When you’re assigned a problem to solve, you may not have a team behind you to execute the work – you will be the Analyst, Consultant, and Engagement Manager all at once. Plan and set execution expectations accordingly, and be prepared to roll up your sleeves again.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8211; Jeremy Muench, SVP, Operations, McKesson Corporation  | Bain alum</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Team</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>“[In management consulting] there’s less long-term ownership of people, and Managers typically don’t have to deal with a lot of the difficult management issues that come with true reports within an official org structure. In corporate, where there are official reporting structures, you have to figure out how to get the best out of every person on your team – you have to make it work for the long-term and mold / shape individuals. Individual capability will also tend to be less uniform in corporate, which adds to the challenge.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8211; Eng Tan, Vice President, Client Marketing, Asurion  | Booz &amp; Co alum</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Stakeholders</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"> &#8220;<em>You cannot underestimate the value of building a network as soon as you land in corporate. Consulting firms are built to create those networks to facilitate team work and group success. In industry you have to make your own way because it is not always part of the corporate structure. Also, you do need to adjust your expectations on the pace at which things can move or get done. Projects have longer lead times and decisions involve more people than in consulting.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8211; Lanchi Venator, Head of Global Strategic Pricing, Estée Lauder Companies | A.T. Kearney alum</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>&#8220;[A prominent] difference is influence, and realizing its dynamics / importance in business. This can be a difficult one for consultants who are used to leveraging their influence at the C-Suite and Board levels during engagements. When you’re in corporate, influence is leveraged differently and in a more balanced way. It is a give and take across functions as well as an exercise in building personal / organizational brand and credibility. For example, you could pull rank maybe once or twice, but it’s more political than that – you’ll get a bad rep very promptly. You have to find different ways to influence the actions of others.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8211; Eng Tan, Vice President, Client Marketing, Asurion | Booz &amp; Co alum</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n",

      "content": "<hr />\n<p>In our interview with Jamie Iredale, Chief Procurement Officer of the Australia Post, he notes “Sometimes the best decisions are the moves you don’t make.”</p>\n<p>And we agree.</p>\n<p>But with the increased visibility of connections, and our increased ability to <a title=\"connectionmap\" href=\"http://inmaps.linkedinlabs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">map those connections via digital networks</a>, we also think that it makes the delicate handling of situations (like how to reject an offer) that much more important</p>\n<p>In today’s world, there are more bridges to burn: how many Linkedin connections does the person standing on the other side of that charred tie have?</p>\n<p>The consultant skill set is <a title=\"McKinsey Big Data Report 2013\" href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/big_data_the_next_frontier_for_innovation\" target=\"_blank\">a highly valuable one</a>, and chances are you won’t take every offer you get. Here are the golden rules to ensure you don’t tarnish (or incinerate) your reputation for opportunities down the line.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>Golden Rule 1: Maintain transparency <em><br />\n</em></strong></p>\n<p>Everyone wants to make themselves as attractive in interviews as possible – you want the offer regardless. And while we agree that at times you may need to table knee jerk reactions in real time to thoroughly process and assess an opportunity to the fullest, there are issues about which you need to be clear from the start to avoid last minute surprises and scarlet &#8220;D&#8221; for dishonesty when you pass on a role:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Key items you need to cross the line:</strong> If your partner will never move to that specific location, you need a later start date, or know you will not take the role with its given title or salary, etc., you will leave a bad impression if you reject an offer because of these things with no mention of them previously, or asking to suddenly change them with an offer in hand.</li>\n<li><strong>Management of multiple processes:</strong> Juggling multiple interview processes happens often. If you are getting close to an offer and another process is not yet there, or are going between multiple offers, be open about your timing with the company so they can react accordingly (and understand why you then would approach them saying you took something else). And for those of you wondering about counter offers – <a title=\"Forbes-what-should-you-do-when-the-boss-begs-you-to-stay\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2012/08/08/what-should-you-do-when-the-boss-begs-you-to-stay/\" target=\"_blank\">don&#8217;t even think about it.</a></li>\n<li><strong>Financial / compensation information:</strong> If your house is under water, or if you have special insurance needs, a company could very well be willing to overlook or help with these items and bake them into the offer if you are upfront &#8211; but that good faith is lost if they are thrown at them after the fact. On that note, companies (and recruiters representing you to companies) need your correct compensation information to know if you are within the parameters of the job. Both parties are working together to deliver a compelling offer, and if the end verification process exposes misleading information on your part, forget rejecting the offer &#8211; you’ll likely lose the opportunity entirely, as well as the respect of those working with you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>(Note: if you are working with an executive recruiter, they can oftentimes be an advantage in helping you manage the process, as well as take a certain amount of pressure off regarding direct communication with the hiring company. If anything, be sure to at least let them know these key items upfront so they can best advise you on how to proceed while keeping the respect of all those involved.)</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>Golden Rule 2: Negotiate in good faith</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">If you’re not inclined to take the offer in any event, the worst thing you can do is make a bunch of special requests that in truth will not budge your verdict in the end. Special asks throw your hiring manager into the difficult and often political position and process of bending the rules – putting their neck out, speaking with internal HR, getting senior sign offs, etc. to ensure you are good to go. In coming back and saying “Thanks but no thanks,” you’ve not only burned the bridge, you’ve sucked up the ashes in a snow blower and pummeled your recent hiring connection with a steady pile of soot.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>Golden Rule 3: Be pleasant and polite</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It seems obvious, yet there is a reason we’ve included it here. With offers and interview processes, it is easy for individuals to slip into tunnel vision and forget all others involved in the process. From the hiring manager to the recruiter to the internal HR teams, it takes a village, and you want that village to maintain a positive impression of you, and your integrity, for future reference. Follow up &#8211; in a timely manner &#8211; with all those involved as appropriate, even if you are not taking their specific opportunity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>The Takeaway</strong></p>\n<p> No one likes to say &#8220;no&#8221; to others, and the sting lingers a bit after the fact.  Maintain your integrity, transparency, and manners throughout the process, and you&#8217;ll fortify those bridges for future opportunities down the line.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<hr />\n<p>A well-known, self-deprecating jab consultants will often make when describing their exploration of opportunities beyond consulting is that it’s the first time they have really had to “decide” on anything specific in their career.  Like a liberal arts college experience, it has been easy to take classes in different industries or functions without necessarily committing to one subject in particular. So, upon graduation, how do you choose?</p>\n<p>More so than any other industry, having a base in strategy consulting gives you the option to go in many, vastly different directions.</p>\n<p>Below, we’ve compiled three considerations for consultants to identify a career end goal, and a path to achieve their post-consulting goals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>1) Career decisions: What, at your core, excites you?</strong></p>\n<p>Apart from the shared consulting skill set, people want, and are better fit for, different opportunities and tracks.</p>\n<p>Want to be a CEO? As Michelle Kluz, BCG alum and current CEO of a multinational retailer, pointed out in our recent interview, you have to really like being a leader to be in the top job.  She also outlined six key CEO characteristics beyond those typical of consultants you&#8217;ll want to have for success.</p>\n<p>How about a private equity executive, where you can retire early with all the money you’ll make?  In our interview with Maggie, ex-AlixPartners and Business Unit President of a PE portfolio company, she points out: “If you love the idea of being an owner, the money will come, but if you can’t wake up every morning and feel like it’s your money on the line, then it won’t.  I’ve seen a lot of people go into private equity and not make any money. You have to start with the right DNA and set of skills to make it successful.”</p>\n<p>When thinking of a direction for your career, think about your strengths and what you find most exciting.  Zooming out and considering the larger picture, what kinds of opportunities really match up with those traits and interests? If you can identify where you want to end up, and where you think you’ll be happiest, plotting a plan becomes that much easier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>2) You know where you want to go – be prepared to do what it takes to get there.</strong></p>\n<p>So, after some soul searching, you’ve decided you want to become a CEO.  Or a top marketing executive.  Or a fisherman living off your own catch on the coastal waters of Hawaii.  As Kaihan Krippendorff (ex-McKinsey) outlines in <a title=\"Kaihan Krippendorff Fast Company\" href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3014343/how-to-be-a-success-at-everything/the-30-minute-strategy-for-creating-a-successful-path-to-y\" target=\"_blank\">his most recent article for Fast Company</a>, the most productive way to approach this desired end goal may be to write your story backwards, allowing you to define the building blocks you need in order to get there.</p>\n<p>And we agree – building blocks are a great way to strategically group skills or experiences you&#8217;ll need under your belt to get from point A to your desired B, C, or D.  Just remember, building blocks are not meant to be as glamorous as the end result.<b> </b></p>\n<p>If you want to be in an awesome CEO or general management role (note: the quality of GM / CEO roles varies widely – think CEO of a billion dollar plus company versus CEO of a doomed startup), chances are you need some additional experiences (like a marketing or operational role leading a team in industry) before you are qualified for that type of position.  Be practical in setting your expectations, and value your learning experiences along the way.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>3) Avoid tunnel vision</strong></p>\n<p>You have a goal…and a plan!  You’re all set to conquer your building blocks and quickly catapult yourself to your ultimate dream job.</p>\n<p>An important thing to keep in mind as you charge ahead: Study that odd looking tree that might not even logically belong in the forest every once in a while.  Being focused is great, and you’ve put all that work into thinking about what you actually want to do.  But it is also important to be open enough to take advantage of the opportunities on the side of the road that you didn’t necessarily have in mind.  As we pointed out when discussing Big Data and your next opportunity, it doesn’t hurt to consider your options, and it might just lead you down a better, more successful path than you had initially imagined.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<hr />\n<p>We recently chatted with Michelle Kluz, ex-BCGer turned CEO of fashion forward multinational retailer BBRC Retail and one of its leading brands, diva, about her transition directly from consulting to the top job at her company. Apart from being a warm and very enjoyable conversationalist, she’s also quickly establishing herself in her new role, successfully driving her company forward with high growth and an expanding global footprint.</p>\n<p>As she wraps up her first year, we dug beyond <a title=\"Debunking the Myths of the First 100 Days\" href=\"https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/leadership_human_resources_debunking_the_myths_of_the_first_100_days/\" target=\"_blank\">more general CEO insights</a> and focused on Michelle’s perspective as a former consultant, her experience thus far, and any insights she has for consultants coveting the corner office. One question we asked: In the sea of consultants who focus on the CEO role, who are the ones who should really think about it?</p>\n<p>With the caveat “Being CEO is not for everyone,” Michelle identifies six key CEO traits consultants don&#8217;t typically have:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>1)</b> <b>Charisma</b> <strong>&#8211;</strong><b> </b><em>“It’s not just about being smart and coming up with a great strategy or vision – you need to be energetic and articulate, and have the ability to inspire the team to drive your company forward.”</em></p>\n<p><b>2) </b><b>Decisiveness and willingness to make tough calls <strong>&#8211; </strong></b><em>&#8220;Some people want to be nice – too nice – and avoid making the tough changes that may be most necessary to the organization because they will ruffle some feathers. Certainly, my experiences at BCG have helped me understand how to uncover issues quickly and drive to a solution or a few key findings. But, it’s quite different than consulting because as CEO, you have to implement the decisions, not just recommend the direction to take.”  </em></p>\n<p><b>3)</b><b> Ability to see clarity and order out of chaos <strong>&#8211; </strong></b><em>&#8220;There is so much information, and to be able to pull out pieces from various departments and put them together into a cohesive whole that leads to better decision making is the difference between a good individual contributor and a leader.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p><b>4) </b><b>An understanding of what motivates your employees <strong>&#8211; </strong></b><em>“Do whatever you can to get the best out of [your team]. I really view the core of my role as making sure I remove roadblocks so that everyone can perform well.”</em></p>\n<p><b>5) Product experience <strong>&#8211; </strong></b><em>“[It] may be a surprise, but I think it’s really important to be a product person if you sell products&#8230; As CEO of a product company, I need to take a lead role in the design and buying process so I ensure we are delivering what our customers want.”</em></p>\n<p><b>6) Optimism <strong>&#8211; </strong></b><em>“You have to be an optimist in order to set the tone for the team. Despite anything that’s going on beneath the surface (frustration in a meeting, worries over something that is happening in the business, etc.), you must stay positive – within boundaries, of course, or you might seem fake. People are watching everything you do as the CEO, and when you lose faith, they do.”</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "short_URL": "http://wp.me/p7C5yw-2dJ",
      "content": "<p>Position: Chief Executive Officer</p>\n<p>Current Firm: Pure Barre</p>\n<p>* At the time of this interview Michelle was the Chief Executive Officer of diva, BBRC Retail</p>\n<p><em>After 6+ years at BCG specializing in the luxury / fashion retail industry, you left for your current role as CEO of a large multinational retail and fashion company. From our vantage point as an executive search firm, we know you weren’t the average BCG Principal, and you landed a not-so-average opportunity post-consulting. How did you select and secure your current role, and how did your unique experiences set you up for success?</em></p>\n<p>My time spent at BCG certainly had a big impact on landing my current role, but I think it’s important to note that I also had the benefit of eight years experience, ending in senior management roles, in industry before I went into consulting. When I went to BCG, I was very specific and targeted in terms of what I wanted beyond my management experience, which was a breadth of experience focused in the retail space. Along with the combination of my time in industry and my focus in consulting, I took advantage of an externship opportunity while at BCG which helped set a base – spending a year as the acting Chief Merchandising Officer of a $400 million revenue retailer that was a client of ours at the time. In terms of the opportunity, when I returned to BCG from my externship, I wasn’t planning to leave – I was happy there and well on the path to Partner. A couple of years later, I was asked to help head up a project in Australia for a few months (my husband had moved to Australia after he left BCG, so it wasn’t hard to convince me to go). While there, I met a BCG alum who is now CEO of one of Australia’s leading fashion retailers, and she referred me to someone she knew who was looking for a CEO to lead one of his companies.  Not expecting to get the job, I had a call with my now boss (Chairman of the Board), and two days later had the offer – so it was really through the BCG alumni network that I even heard about the opportunity. As for why I took the role, it was the trifecta for me: First, it was a CEO role, so I knew it would be a high impact position. Second, it was for a fashion retail company. Finally, it was located where my husband had moved.  Beyond that, despite my lack of true CEO experience, the person who would be my boss said he was looking for someone who was smart, had global experience, and who “got” retail – and he would coach me on the rest.  I thought “Wow, this is someone who is really going to invest in me,” and it was an opportunity I just couldn’t pass up.</p>\n<p><em>You are in the top job in a growing, near-$1 billion revenue company. How did you prepare yourself to hit the ground running?</em></p>\n<p>I wasn’t naïve enough to think that I was going to be an amazing CEO on day one, but there’s only so much you can do to prepare beforehand – even though I tried to prepare myself the best I could. I did a lot of store visits to get to know the customer, products, and brand, and I asked for / studied all the quarterly financials from the few years prior so I had a bit of a baseline. I also read a lot of books, blogs, etc. that various friends and colleagues recommended and talked to a few retail CEOs that I know, but in the end, there was really one piece of advice that ended up being truly valuable: don’t make any major decisions within your first month. Do a lot of listening and get to know the company, the people, and the way things are done. Otherwise you can put things in motion that may not have been right because you hadn’t fully understood the company at the time.</p>\n<p><em>What specifically have you leaned on from your consulting experience in your current role, and what else have you employed to bridge the gap in your first CEO position?</em></p>\n<p>In consulting, I learned how to think about problems from different angles and come up with a solution relatively quickly. As CEO, I am now in charge of every function, and I have to admit that I intuitively understand certain functions better than others, so I use these skills almost every day now. After six years at BCG, I think they’re embedded in the way I think and approach situations.</p>\n<p>The next most useful tool I learned in consulting is how to tell a good story. At BCG, writing a concise, powerful story was the key to ensuring the message was delivered and getting buy-in from the intended audience. There’s a good reason that multiple training sessions on writing decks (at all levels) were mandatory at BCG – it’s a hard skill to master. The second part of this was learning how deliver the message verbally for maximum impact.</p>\n<p>As with any new role, there will be gaps until one comes up to speed. In my current role, the most important things I did while I was coming up to speed were to listen, think before I made any decisions at first, and to ask a lot of questions! Also, I found it was critical to have an understanding of how the company operated. To that end, I spent four days during my first week working as a salesgirl in a couple of our different stores in Sydney. It was humbling: the first day, I was so green that I had to learn how to operate the register! Also, I had to help replenish the stock, and it took me about seven hours to do it, while the sales team basically rolled around on the floor laughing at me. They told me they could have done it in two. The fifth day, I was a picker in our warehouse. Every day, each picker is measured on productivity… needless to say, I came in dead last and left with sore feet (tip: don’t wear heels in a warehouse!). It was hard work, but it forced me to quickly learn some of our systems, understand the product better, and connect with our customers and team members. It probably also gave me some credibility in the head office and helped set the tone that I am willing to dive in and get my hands dirty.</p>\n<p><em>Arguably, the CEO spot is the most coveted position out there. Is it all it’s cracked up to be? What were some of the surprises, and is there anything you just can’t prepare for?</em></p>\n<p>It’s funny, because I think people have this idea that being the CEO is glamorous. It is exciting, but in reality it’s a lot of hard work, and you agonize over decisions because you are ultimately on the line for them. A bad decision can impact a lot of people!</p>\n<p>In terms of surprises, I would point to the people and human resources aspect of the role. Every company’s culture is unique, and you need to establish an understanding of what motivates your employees. At BCG, everyone was similar – all highly driven, always willing to go the extra mile, and all motivated by similar things, so it was easier to manage my teams and get the best out of them. Compared to consulting, you get more of a mixed bag of talent and in industry, and the range of what motivates people is just so much wider. I actually spend around one third of my time on HR and talent topics, which wasn’t something I expected coming in.</p>\n<p><em>It takes a certain kind of person to have success in the CEO role. Apart from the traits that are associated with most all consultants (highly intelligent, driven, etc.) what other characteristics do you think you need to be successful (i.e. in the sea of consultants who focus on the CEO role, who are the ones who should really think about it)?</em></p>\n<p>Being a CEO is not for everyone. You have to truly enjoy being a leader. In my opinion, here are the characteristics that I think are important:</p>\n<p>The first characteristic is a certain level of charisma. It’s not just about being smart and coming up with a great strategy or vision – you need to be energetic and articulate, and have the ability to inspire the team to drive your company forward. Although I think that a certain level of charisma is natural, I do believe what one has can be honed – I’m probably a better example of the latter than the former! In line with this, I think a high level of EQ is critical.</p>\n<p>Second, you also need a level of decisiveness and willingness to make tough calls. Some people want to be nice – too nice – and avoid making the tough changes that may be most necessary to the organization because they will ruffle some feathers. Certainly, my experiences at BCG have helped me understand how to uncover issues quickly and drive to a solution or a few key findings. But, it’s quite different than consulting because as CEO, you have to implement the decisions, not just recommend the direction to take.</p>\n<p>I suppose this leads me to the next trait: The ability to see clarity and order out of chaos. There is so much information, and to be able to pull out pieces from various departments and put them together into a cohesive whole that leads to better decision making is the difference between a good individual contributor and a leader. Consultants are generally good at this – this is what they are paid to do!</p>\n<p>Fourth, and I touched on this before – I think it’s of utmost importance to understand what motivates your key team members and do whatever you can to get the best out of them. I really view the core of my role as making sure I remove roadblocks so that everyone can perform well.</p>\n<p>This next one may be a surprise, but I think it’s really important to be a product person if you sell products. Sometimes, I think my background in design – I have an undergrad degree in it, and I worked as a designer for a few years – comes in as handy as what I learned at BCG. As CEO of a product company, I need to take a lead role in the design and buying process so I ensure we are delivering what our customers want.</p>\n<p>Finally, you have to be an optimist in order to set the tone for the team. Despite anything that’s going on beneath the surface (frustration in a meeting, worries over something that is happening in the business, etc.), you must stay positive – within boundaries, of course, or you might seem fake. People are watching everything you do as the CEO, and when you lose faith, they do. For example, I had to make some layoffs in my first couple of months, and I’m sure people were worried about what was next. I had to communicate that same day what was going on, why, and outline what our future plans were. I was super nervous – after all, I was new and still getting myself established so there was no real reason for the team to trust me yet, but then I realized that I had to put that aside, talk about the recent wins that the team had had before I even joined, and the amazing things that were in motion. I had to get them excited about our journey.</p>\n<p><em>Having maintained a focus on the luxury / fashion retail industry for the latter half of your career, what are your thoughts on industry specialization and its effects on the opportunity for post-consulting advancement? Any advice for consultants aiming to get into the industry?</em></p>\n<p>Actually, when I joined BCG, I knew that I immediately wanted to specialize in retail, and I chose the firm because of the true variety of retail experience I felt would be available to me. I was also lucky in that I was able to quickly land a few of the “sexy” retail projects in fashion, which in turn set me up for others down the line. Specializing allowed me to have a set of fantastic experiences, particularly growing a couple of luxury businesses in Asia, that were incredibly important in my career and likely imperative to my ability to get my current role.</p>\n<p>I will say, though, that despite my personal experience, I do not think specialization is right for everyone. I’ve seen a lot of people who don’t want to specialize, and understandably so. For new consultants who don’t really know what they want to do, being in consulting is a massive opportunity to learn about different industries and functional areas. But I do think it is important to try to get on projects that align with areas that interest you. As you know, with consulting, you could end up on a large project that lasts a year, then move to another project in a similar space that lasts six months because you’re already an “expert” in that area, and before you know it, you’re a manager, at which point it starts getting hard to switch from one industry or functional area to another. That’s not a good situation to be in.</p>\n<p>Whether specializing or taking the general route in the top consulting firms, however, I do believe that it can be more about the teams with which you’re working over the specific content. Again, I was very lucky in that there was a small group of us focused on fashion and retail during my time at BCG, so I was able to grow close with those people as I continued to work with them throughout my consulting career, and I count some of these people among my mentors today. My advice would be that while you are in consulting, get close to the Partners on the projects that you enjoy – they’ll be incredibly knowledgeable on the subject you’re dealing with, and will have fantastic relationships with people in the industry who could be clients – or even your employer – down the line.</p>\n<p>A final note – consulting is great, but don’t be afraid to take an industry role if it comes along. When I took on my current role I had to ramp up very quickly, and there are some things that would have come much easier had I had more actual industry experience beforehand in specific areas – take Merchandise Planning, for example. There’s nothing like doing it yourself and really getting your hands dirty. I was fortunately able to lean on my BCG externship experience to some extent, but to that end, my advice would be to make good connections with the people who have the experience / expertise within specific areas of your industry – they can be incredibly helpful, especially in those areas you might be lacking.</p>\n<p><em>What do you find most exciting about the luxury / fashion retail space today?</em></p>\n<p>With everything on the web and the interconnectivity of people and products, I think the industry as a whole is changing more rapidly than it ever has in the past. I was just reading an article, for example, that argued seasons won’t matter as much because people will still want the fashion of the moment, whether it is summer in New York or freezing some place in the other hemisphere. It requires retailers to be much more nimble. People can always price shop and compare as well, so you lose a certain uniqueness there – it puts an added pressure on the brand to be the most up-to-date and on top of the hottest trends.</p>\n<p><em>Knowing you and your husband, Dave Kluz, we know that each of you have had fantastic career opportunities that required spanning the globe and numerous BCG offices – at times (or many times) landing you an ocean or continent away from the other. What are your thoughts on international experience and travel re: opportunities, and how do you think it has contributed to your success as an executive? Do you have any thoughts to share with folks who are not as open to relocation and travel as you have been (pros / cons)?</em></p>\n<p>If you have the opportunity to go to another office, take it. It is a very different experience to actually live in a country – when I worked in China for two years, for example, I was able to experience a BCG office with an entirely different language, culture, etc. I think I worked in 10 different countries while at BCG, and that global experience has given me so many opportunities. I understand the world better, and I am a more successful executive because of it.</p>\n<p>Of course, I understand that you can have success while staying in one place, and people stay put for a variety of reasons – if you have a family, or want to settle down, for example. The cons of constant travel and relocation are clear – you’re away from your friends, away from your husband in some cases, and you’re living out of a suitcase. As a girl, you can get really sick of your outfits because there’s just not that much room to bring different handbags and shoes, etc. (laughs). But for me, travel and international experience has always been a major factor. The benefit of working at a firm like BCG is that you’re surrounded by similar people who are all around the same age – it’s easy to make friends, and there is this fantastic comradery around travel. You get to wake up every day in a different city to explore and take in, sometimes even a different language. Sometimes I miss the comradery around that aspect of consulting.</p>\n<p><em>As CEO of diva today, what are your goals for personal development and career growth?</em></p>\n<p>Having been in my position for almost a year, I’ve finally established a level of comfort with the different aspects of my role. I don’t have a time limit on what I’m doing – as of now, my goal is to be the best CEO I can be, for this company, and to continue to see the business succeed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Enter the strategy consultant.</p>\n<p>Data and its analysis are the bread and butter of consulting firms, and the means by which consultants can give valuable recommendations and insights to their client. With that, we as an executive search firm are often surprised when we notice a lack of emphasis on data in an equally important area: the search process for a new opportunity.</p>\n<p>Rather than taking a job because you’ll be able to work with your friend from consulting, or the one that offers the most flash on the surface, here are a few ways to further elevate data in the job process:</p>\n<p><strong>1)</strong> <b>Take the call, go on the interview.  </b>Just because a company or opportunity is not something you initially thought of in passing does not mean it’s a bad one for you.  Similarly, if you’re happy at your current role and hadn’t planned to move, there’s no harm in checking out an opportunity or two to get a sense of your market worth (ex. Bryan Falchuk, Head of U.S. Operations at Beazley PLC, revealed in our interview that he initially shirked early outreach for his first role at the company because he wasn’t looking at the time).  Taking the opportunity to learn more means that worst case scenario, you know what a real offer looks like to compare to others down the line.  Best case scenario, you&#8217;ve landed yourself a new, great opportunity that has put you on a path you might not have considered otherwise.</p>\n<p><strong>2)</strong> <b>Do your homework.</b>  When considering an opportunity, or weighing options against one another, scrutinize the company, its position in its respective industry, and the people within it. What are this company’s <i>real </i>odds for success and growth compared to its competitors (versus promises or wishful thinking)? Have they hired consultants previously?  What is the growth path for your role, and is it proven?  The valuable data you gain from this exploration will help set apart the good from the bad beyond your gut feel.</p>\n<p><strong>3)</strong> <b>Tune up your own visible data / brand.</b> In looking at new opportunities, it comes without saying that the company you’re interested in will gather data about you as well. It’s important to check on your personal brand, and how you might appear both digitally and otherwise.  Make your data work for you and give them the best impression before you get in the door.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Not surprisingly, most consultants who did leave their Big Three firm for industry left after 2-3 years post-MBA, which, with no previous consulting experience, is right around the first expected flight.</p>\n<p>For the industry landscape, it will be interesting to see how this changes in years to come.  For this specific study, 2006 MBAs who went from consulting to industry most typically went into Technology, Manufacturing, and Financial Services.</p>\n<p><em> <em>*Raines International’s information about the moves of 2006 MBAs  was gathered from our internal database and confirmed through online resources (Linkedin, etc.) as of June 2013.</em></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Position: Vice President and CFO</p>\n<p>Current Firm: Mattel Consumer Products</p>\n<p><em>You spent your pre-MBA career at Mars &amp; Co, leaving after five years and two promotions to go to business school. What prompted you to pursue your MBA at that point, rather than earlier or never?</em></p>\n<p>Up until that point, I was still learning things and making traction. Mars isn’t the type of firm to look at a calendar and tell you it’s time to go back to school. You stay until you feel like it’s time to do something else. When I left, it was because it felt like good timing and I wanted to get my MBA at that point rather than wait a few years longer.</p>\n<p><em>Did you ever consider the Partner path?</em></p>\n<p>No, never. Selling business wasn’t what excited me about consulting. I’m a business junkie – I like the art and science of business. In consulting I liked getting wide exposure to business at the start of my career. Eventually, however, I realized that while every consulting project is fun to talk about around the dinner table, every project is ultimately a bit of a grind when it comes time to do the work.</p>\n<p><em>You then spent your summer internship at Disney, and joined the company after business school for a very successful 13 years at the company. What advice would you give to consultants who are evaluating similar corporate opportunities? How can they know there will be opportunity to grow?</em></p>\n<p>Employees of the service sector need to understand that corporations are organized in layers – the corporate level is one layer, but there are also divisions and business units. There are also global, regional, and local layers. Consultants need to conduct due diligence around what they’ll be doing and what other people around them will be doing. You wouldn’t buy a house without knowing what the adjacent houses look like, and you shouldn’t take a job without knowing what the roles adjacent to yours look like. For example, let’s say you get a role in Digital. Find out how many other people in the company believe themselves to be responsible for Digital, and in what capacity. You don’t want to accidentally end up in a role that is shared with several other people, at least without knowing it going in. The reality is that big companies have lots of adjacencies and occasional overlaps, but you don’t want to be tone-deaf to that when evaluating options. Sometimes there’s a reason why a role is open!</p>\n<p><em>What initially interested you about Disney, and what kept you at the company?</em></p>\n<p>I had experienced good success with consulting and thought, “What now?” I knew I liked sports and movies. Disney was a global company with a good brand, and it felt like a good transition point. I didn’t initially plan to stay for any particular length of time. I stayed because every two to three years, there was something new and different for me to do. And I knew when that was no longer the case, that it would be the right time to make a transition.</p>\n<p><em>You joined Disney in a finance &amp; planning role, and then quickly climbed the ranks to become the CFO of a business unit there. What advice would you give to consultants who want to be able to similarly hit the ground running?</em></p>\n<p>It helps to be able to work at a consultant’s pace to help compensate for that initial lack of experience, but it’s important to remember that you can’t force everyone else to work at that pace. You need to learn how to blend well with a non-consulting team. Once you leave consulting, the hard part is not just getting the correct answer – it’s working with people and influencing opinions.</p>\n<p><em>What specifically about your experience in consulting has helped you get where you are today?</em></p>\n<p>Consulting allowed me to be curious about business the same way a sports fan is curious about sports, without being too functionally defined. That broader perspective of how business works gave me an edge early on.</p>\n<p><em>You recently moved into a CFO role at Mattel Consumer Products. Having worked with large, global brands in the toy and interactive media realm specifically, what do you find most exciting about the space?</em></p>\n<p>This industry is not so different from other industries. Business models tend to be similar across industries. It just happens to be fun when the business model is centered on Barbie or Winnie the Pooh. It’s fun to think about the consumer base for these brands, and to be able to pull the levers of where these brands go.</p>\n<p><em>Any advice for consultants who are looking to move into this particular industry?</em></p>\n<p>Some consulting skills are transferrable, and others are not. Being super smart does not compensate for a total lack of relevant experience. So it’s good to leverage your consulting experience into something adjacent to the opportunities you’re seeking. Build a bridge for the hiring manager and be able to show that you won’t be starting from zero.</p>\n<p>If you have spent a lot of time working in another industry, you might lose the broader perspective that business models in that industry may be similar to business models in this industry. When making an industry switch, be able to articulate to the hiring manager why industry A and industry G are more similar than meets the eye.</p>\n<p><em>Admittedly, you’re now a very old man. If you had to go back and do anything differently, what would it be? And don’t say “this interview.”</em></p>\n<p>This question makes me think of conversations I’ve had with other former consultants over the past 20 years, many of whom ended up kind of professionally adrift. The longer you stay in consulting, the more you need to think about what your competitive advantage will be in the future – especially if selling business isn’t your bread and butter. There are two types of hiring situations you might face. In one, the hiring manager approaches a candidate and says “You’re smart, you have interesting experience, and we’ve heard good things about you… why don’t you give this job a try?”</p>\n<p>But more often the pendulum swings toward the other hiring situation, which is, “We want someone who has spent five years doing this exact job at our competitor.” What if you meet that qualification but you’re not sure that you want to continue doing that role? If you attempt to switch to a role in which you haven’t developed proficiency, your competitive edge is lost. Or what if you haven’t been at anyone’s competitor for five consecutive years because you’ve been “professionally snacking”? If you’re hopping around, your competitive edge is lost.</p>\n<p>Everyone inevitably develops experience in specific areas, either by design or default. We see 40-year-old NFL coaches and think, “Wow, he’s only 40 and he’s coaching a professional team!” The reason he is able to do that is because he has focused on football and only football for the last 20 years of his career. He fought his way to the top in that one area. At some point you need to look back and ask yourself, “What have I been building towards? What proficiencies have I been developing over the last 20 years?” It’s better to figure that out sooner rather than later.</p>\n<p>What makes you successful in the early part of your career probably won’t make you successful in the middle part of your career. The challenge is to figure out what your evolution will look like, both personally and professionally. Let’s say you have the opportunity to travel to the South Pole to take wind measurements for five years. Or maybe you could spend five years as a ticket taker at a London theater, interacting with hundreds of people on a daily basis. Either of these experiences would have a profound impact on your personal and professional evolution. If you can identify ahead of time where you want to go, you can work backwards to determine which opportunities will allow you to get there.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Consulting firms are known for sending their consultants all over the world to do just that, which brings us to our second fixed element:  if someone needs to get from A to B, in person, they still need to hop on a plane, train, or automobile to get there.</p>\n<p>Consultants frequently travel (to put it mildly), and we want to put a friendly reminder out there that the power of that in-person interaction does not end at A or begin again at B. Some of the most influential business and networking connections are still made today with the person at someone’s left or right on an airplane, or in the same car on the Amtrak Acela. With all of the time you spend traveling from one client site to another, remember to look up from finishing that deck or catching up on your emails every once in a while – many consultants bring in the next big client or facilitate their next big career move by taking advantage of the natural face-to-face interactions you may not be considering otherwise.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<div class=\"the-insight\">\n<hr />\n<p><em>Being a top-tier management consultant makes for a very competitive candidate at Fortune 500, Private Equity, and thriving startup companies. Beyond the high-performance record and skills gained in that role, however, there are many areas in which a candidate can further differentiate him or herself from the rest of the candidate pool. Raines International has placed hundreds of current and former management consultants at the Manager through C-level, and the quotes included in this section come from hiring managers at your target firms. Here we highlight the things you should expect and consider in every corporate interview that will help navigate your transition out of consulting with a competitive edge over your peers (which can be as simple as avoiding common mistakes).</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What To Expect</strong></p>\n<p>Things to consider in every interview to better fit your target company</p>\n<p>PREPARATION: KNOW YOUR TARGET INDUSTRY</p>\n<p>Fortune 500 / Corporate:</p>\n<p><em>“For Director-level and above candidates, they should know my competitors, what analysts are saying, and key concerns…Those who are good will do the prep, and if theyʼre still with the firm will be savvy enough to use BCGʼs inter-company knowledge database. Simply put, enough candidates do the prep that I can just hire one from that group rather than risk it on someone who didn’t. Not doing the prep makes it easier for me to make my selection.”</em> (E-Commerce Executive, BCG Alum)</p>\n<p>Private Equity:</p>\n<p><em>“You need to enjoy the dedication and getting into the nitty gritty of what drives change, versus managing seven different projects where youʼre zooming in and zooming out. This is a very different skill set and DNA. Do you enjoy doing work on your own? How do you handle being thrown into the weeds without a support system? Be very honest with yourself about whether you are up for this aspect, otherwise it will not be the right move.”</em> (Private Equity Executive, AlixPartners Alum)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>PREPARATION: KNOW YOUR TARGET COMPANY</p>\n<p><em>“With the level of people I hire (Project Leaders and Principals), I feel confident going in that they have the intellectual, analytical, problem solving, and project management abilities and skills that we need. Very few candidates at this level donʼt meet these bars…thatʼs the up or out model. So I spend most of my time on ʻfitʼ for our company specifically. I know our culture, and I need to feel comfortable that they can work with the corporate and divisional executives.” </em>(Vice President, Fortune 500 Manufacturer, BCG Alum)</p>\n<p>Fortune 500 / Corporate:</p>\n<p><em>“In these kinds of roles, theyʼre looking for a skill set very close to the BCG skill set. The questions are, are you amiable, are you really interested in the company, and why?”</em> (Fortune 500 Technology Executive, BCG Alum)</p>\n<p><em>“Donʼt just say ʻI want to work for _____ because youʼre a great company.ʼ Tell us what youʼre passionate about that lines up with our business. We are fast-moving, entrepreneurial, and very tech focused – thatʼs what we look for.”</em> (Fortune 500 Technology Executive, McKinsey Alum)</p>\n<p>Private Equity:</p>\n<p><em>“All PE firms are different, and there are several different models, so research the firm in question through the executive recruiter, mutual connections, etc. One of the other firms that is also a big hirer of consulting talent has more of a coaching model or armʼs length approach, where executives oversee the work but do not necessarily execute it. Others are even more distant. My firm is the polar opposite – you might be deployed at a single portfolio company for 3 to 4 days a week for 6 to 18 months. Show that you can work and thrive on working on your own.”</em> (Private Equity Executive)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>PREPARATION: KNOW YOUR INTERVIEWERS</p>\n<p>Whenever possible, know the backgrounds of the people who are interviewing you, and whether or not they have consulting backgrounds. Former consultants will expect you to be more on the ball in some senses (how to navigate cases, etc.) but may be more lenient in others (seeming overconfident or arrogant). Remember to use your network and connect with consultants at firms you are targeting. When possible, ask the recruiter whether this is acceptable, and be thoughtful with messages you share, as they may circulate to your detriment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>PAPERWORK</p>\n<p>When they say it is “required”, it means it is required. Most companies will ask you to fill out an online application, and occasionally a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). Take into consideration that every person in the company has likely done the same thing, and that many times the hiring process cannot move forward until administration has certain things on file. It is fine to ask questions, especially if an NDA is involved. It is fine to ask your lawyer neighbor for an opinion, but keep in mind that you are sending messages to your potential future employer. If three candidates comply and you donʼt, their selection is easier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>REFERENCES</p>\n<p>References may be asked for before your profile is introduced to a client. Or they may be conducted after the offer letter is extended. Be prepared to provide references that will be accessible quickly and easily. If you havenʼt announced your intentions to transition out, think of two or three former colleagues whom you can take into your confidence. Donʼt slow down your own process by a week or more.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>TIMELINE</p>\n<p>Be patient with elongated interview processes – coordinating the schedules of executives on both the candidate and interviewer side can be challenging.</p>\n<p>Donʼt be needy. If you are not alerted that you are “the winner” quickly after your interview, this does not mean that you did not get the job. There are many components that can lengthen the process such as scheduling, ability to meet for feedback, and logistics. Try not to communicate annoyance / frustration…soften the message. Restrain yourself from offering the hiring manager / company your recommendations on how to make the process better. Get the job first!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING</p>\n<p>Many companies do not utilize psychological testing at all, or only do so at the senior level. Some examples:</p>\n<p><em>Hogan Personality Test (HPI)</em>: A 15-20 minute test consisting of 206 true or false items. Scores are instantaneous and based on the Five-Factor Model (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, openness). Distributed online.</p>\n<p><em>NEO Personality Inventory (NEO PI-R)</em>: Comes in a shorter and longer format, lasting 10-15 minutes or 30-40 minutes respectively. The test contains 240 questions based on the Five-Factor model with a rating scale ranging from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree.” Distributed in written or digital form.</p>\n<p><em>SmartAssessment®</em>: A 4-hour assessment conducted by ghSMART  in which candidates are quizzed extensively about their career history. The client then receives an in-depth assessment on the candidate’s leadership abilities including interpersonal  skills, enthusiasm, and intellect. Distributed in-person.</p>\n<p><em>Caliper Profile</em>: The test is not timed, but is usually completed in 90-minutes. The assessment analyzes 25 personality traits and evaluates how well a candidate is suited for a specific role. The test provides information on the candidate’s strengths, weaknesses, capabilities, and motivation. Distributed in written or digital form.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Things To Remember</strong></p>\n<p>There are ways to differentiate yourself positively from the consultant candidate pool, and there are also ways to distinguish yourself negatively. This section highlights what to keep in mind as you are going through your interviews, as well as some typical interview process components that you should be prepared to handle accordingly.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>CONSIDER THE LEVEL OF YOUR TARGET POSITION AND MARKET YOURSELF ACCORDINGLY</p>\n<p><em>“For Director-level and above, they have to have that executive presence, because they will be working face to face with a guy running a $2 billion division. They have to be good listeners, make eye contact and demonstrate their ability to talk, but also know when to stop and listen to give interviewers an opening to ask a question. They canʼt write everything down and ask ʻCan you give me two minutes to think about this?ʼ – that doesnʼt fly with a CEO. He wonʼt give you two minutes to think about it.”</em> (Fortune 500 Manufacturer Executive, BCG Alum)</p>\n<p><em>“It is difficult to find consultants who are not too junior (who need a lot of coaching and training) but also not too senior (already a salesman). For senior people, they have to convey they are still doers, and can lead teams and roll up their sleeves. Many consulting firms claim they implement, but there are few that do, so candidates have to be ready to speak to their bias for action with concrete examples.”</em> (Private Equity Executive)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>PHONE INTERVIEWS</p>\n<p>Phone interviews can be with HR, Talent Acquisition, a peer, or a hiring manager. Take them seriously. Oftentimes they are your first impression with the company, and with a person who may have a large say in your candidacy down the road (a la “Every Vote Counts” below).</p>\n<p>If you schedule the phone interviews several days in advance, try to avoid being in an airport, donʼt take it while driving, try to be in a quiet place where you can focus, ideally on a landline. Sadly, lots of phone interviews donʼt go well because candidates talk too long (unfocused) or sound tired (because you are). Pump up the energy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>EVERY VOTE COUNTS</p>\n<p>Oftentimes the entire interview team, not just the hiring manager, decides whether a candidate should receive an offer or not. From formal scorecards to a simple thumbs-up or thumbs-down approach, each person you talk with could have a large impact on your application status. Remember that every interview and interaction must go well, even peer to peer, reception, and admin conversations. Seriously, this sounds like common sense, but most candidates will say to us after their interviews “I really hit it off with the hiring manager, but didnʼt connect as well with the others, but I think the hiring manager is the real decision maker here”. Wrong, unless the hiring manager wants to risk alienating his or her peers while demonstrating poor judgment in team building.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>DON’T BE TOO MUCH OF A CONSULTANT</p>\n<p>Executives at major companies constantly cite overconfidence and perceived arrogance as a major flaw in consultant candidates. “They have to remember that all of these line managers have worked with external management consultants before…and are already very successful because they are great managers. The ʻIʼve done all these great thingsʼ approach doesnʼt work; it isnʼt humble enough. Itʼs difficult because a candidate wants to impress the interviewers in an interview, but cannot come across as a know-it all” (Fortune 500 Manufacturing Executive, BCG Alum). Remember to exude confidence rather than superiority, and to adjust accordingly to the interview style and personality of your interviewers.</p>\n<p>Focus on the positives and upside, not just the risks facing the company in question. Consultants love to quickly get a sense for a company’s strengths and weaknesses, and seem to gravitate to the weaknesses when asking questions during interviews. This can make you come across as a negative person, whereas companies want people who “make things happen.” Obviously, take the time to discuss potential threats to the company, but don’t weight the discussion that way.  At one extreme, it sounds like, “I’ve spent 15 minutes assessing your company, which I wasn’t previously familiar with. But in the 15 minutes I spent thinking about you and learning about your industry, I’ve come away concerned that your business model is fundamentally flawed and that the most recent app I downloaded to my iPhone for free will replace your business within a year or two.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>COMPENSATION</p>\n<p><em>Current Consultants:</em></p>\n<p>“I don’t see how my compensation is relevant at this point” sounds like nails on a chalkboard, especially when it follows a candid discussion about your career, strengths/weaknesses, why you’re open to a new challenge, and what you’re hoping to accomplish in the next stage of your career.  Some recruiters, primarily inexperienced ones, may let you get away with not disclosing what ~95% of normal executives share matter-of-factly.  There are two groups of people who are typically reluctant to share their compensation information: 1) those who are underpaid, and 2) consultants who are 0-2 years out of business school.  Basically, everyone else “gets it” and is either upfront about their current compensation package or will share it when we explain why it is important.  It is up to you whether or not you are upfront, but we recommend that you bite the bullet and share the information.  If 10 people express interest in an opportunity, and 9 of them are transparent and 1 of them is not, and all 10 have pretty similar backgrounds (same academics, same tier consulting firm, comparable pre-MBA experience), being fishy about compensation will simply eliminate you from consideration.  Even if you can begin the process with an attractive company, you will stand out as being somewhat deceptive.  Not the best way to begin a relationship.</p>\n<p><em>Former Consultants:</em></p>\n<p>For those in corporate settings: surprise endings can damage the positivity surrounding your candidacy.   Know your compensation breakdown and history, and be prepared to disclose the information.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>TRAVEL</p>\n<p>Respect the travel budget of the company at which you are interviewing. Corporations can have a strict cap for candidate travel, so try and be flexible with what you are given. If you arenʼt, it will not only complicate matters, but could highlight an unwillingness to follow their practices.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>SCHEDULING</p>\n<p>Keep the recruiter, HR, hiring manager (whomever you are coordinating with directly) updated with a) upcoming vacations that will reduce your availability, and b) other interviews and pending offers. This helps them speed up their process, if possible (donʼt bluff, though).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>And Remember…</em></p>\n<p>They are interviewing you.  Yes, there might be five companies lining up to meet you, and you might expect an offer or two to come in, but don’t let that go to your head.  If you have been presented by an executive search firm, then you are one of several candidates with the right skill set for this position.</p>\n<p>If things go well, they will extend you an offer, and you will work there.  Begin building relationships on Day One. Let your reputation precede you in a good way.</p>\n<p><strong>They want to hire someone they like. Be Likable.</strong></p>\n</div>\n<h3></h3>\n",

      "content": "<hr />\n<p>With only a few weeks left before spring arrives, thousands of households are gearing up for their annual purging and polishing for a clean start to the new season. Our question is: why does this time-honored tradition only apply to the domestic?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Even if you’re not actively looking outside of your current professional role, it’s always best to be your freshest in the event that the perfect opportunity lands in your inbox.  Some things you might consider dusting off or cleaning up this spring if you end up preparing for a job hunt:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>Your Resume</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Despite hype that your Linkedin and social media presence are all you should worry about, there is no disputing the importance of a resume when it comes to interviewing and landing your next big role.  It’s the best, most complete representation of your professional self, and chances are that the SVP looking to hire you wants to read through your resume rather than your Facebook page or Twitter feed when reviewing your credentials. So, if you haven’t looked at your resume in a few years, or don’t even know where to find it, it’s time for a tune-up. Without it, your network won’t be able to highlight your profile, executive search firms won’t present you to clients, and slowing the process to make your edits could mean a lost chance at a great opportunity.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>Your Brand</strong></p>\n<p>Now to address the hype around your Linkedin and social media presence – yes, how you appear online is also important.  Say that SVP (or someone on his team) Googles your name – are you making it easier or harder for him / her to hire you? It’s up to each individual how active or present to be online, but the safest bet is to assume anything you post, tweet, etc. – or that is posted about you – is fair game. Google yourself, make sure you have a handle on your online presence, and that you are proactively tailoring it (however small or large it may be) so that it will only help you, not hurt you.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>Your Interviewing Skills</strong></p>\n<p>If it has been 3 years since your last interview, or since the last time you really applied for something that you wanted, then remember how much hard work you used to put into your interviewing prep.  Now that you are more senior, do you think expectations around your communication skills, body language, etc. will be lower or higher? Make sure to have a succinct, prepared answer for what you have achieved and where you would like to go, whether you’d like to stay within your own firm or move on to something different. Which brings us to….</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>What You Actually Want</strong></p>\n<p>This does not mean you need to know exactly what you would like your next step or role to be.  People are approached with opportunities outside of their set ideal all of the time, and those who are open-minded might find themselves happier, making more money, and with a faster path in a role they had never anticipated.  What we’re getting at are the core things that motivate you, drive you, and make you happy. Ideally, these select items will help shape the roles, industries, or companies you may target down the road, and you’ll be able to concisely communicate what you want and why you want it to whoever asks. If you’ve had your head down for a while, consider what you want, and consequently what you are willing to give in order to get there.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<hr />\n<p>By Daniel Smith</p>\n<p>In ancient Greece, a young consultant named Asparagus was on the Partner track at a top-tier firm, and life was good.  But over the years, he grew tired of simply advising on how to improve sheep breeding – it was time to get his hands dirty.  He posted his CV on a few job boards at the local arenas, and tacked it to some columns as well.  Within a few weeks, the calls started rolling in.  Being an alpha male, he needed the job he took to be better than what anyone else in his peer group took. Most people leaving his firm at his level took Director jobs, and subconsciously Asparagus set VP as the minimum “acceptable” level.  He also wanted to have ownership of a business, unlike his peers who were still in advisory roles.</p>\n<p>A month after posting his CV, Asparagus found himself weighing two options – a Director-level staff role with a well-respected livestock business, which would pay him today’s equivalent of $200k base, 30% bonus, and $200k a year in equity.  The equity had a strong track record of paying out at face value.  His other option was a VP-level position with a company nobody had ever heard of, whose future was uncertain, and he would have to relocate to Atlantis to take the job.  This company was willing to pay Asparagus a base salary of $245k and a percentage of the business, which nobody knew how to value.  Asparagus was torn.  He felt that taking the Director position would set him on a path to all that he wanted to achieve, but it didn’t feel as thrilling as the VP-level role. That VP role really popped – it had some swagger to it, put Asparagus’ fate in his hands, and had a base salary that was a solid 25% above the average salary range for his cohort.</p>\n<p>He thought about the two offers all weekend, and his mentor, Logicus, told him that he should take the Director role.  But he wanted to take the VP role, and he was sick of thinking about this.  He wanted the decision to be made already, so he made it.  He accepted the VP position and celebrated with a vacation that he paid for entirely with points.  And he forgot to follow up with the other company, burning that bridge forever, but he was on to greener pastures and had better stuff to do than properly thank a company that had extended him a fantastic offer.</p>\n<p>10 months later, Atlantis started sinking, and Asparagus had to abandon ship.  In some ways, he felt his CV looked great – he had a VP position, had been managing a team, and he had even slowed down the sinking of the city a little bit.  But when he went back to the arena and started posting his CV again, he realized that he was competing with all of the people from his cohort <em>and</em> the year behind.  For the line roles that he really wanted, he primarily found himself competing with people from the well-regarded livestock business that he had chosen not to join. Apparently, the company’s reputation was so good that other companies only wanted former consultants who had spent time in this particular livestock business.</p>\n<p>Asparagus didn’t get the same positive reaction to his CV that he had relished the year before, and he could only secure a few interviews.  A lot of the interviews focused on “What is Atlantis, exactly? What do you guys do?  What were your other options at the time, and why did you choose Atlantis? Couldn’t you tell that the company was doomed?” People were questioning his judgment and his ability to think strategically about his own career.  In the end, Asparagus lost out on the positions he wanted.  Companies kept hiring straight out of the consulting firms, where the candidates all had nice, clean backgrounds, rather than someone with a recent track record of poor judgment. And even though Asparagus said he was open to taking a pay cut for the right role, the HR departments at target companies were all concerned he would leave as soon as a better paying job came along. Fortunately, Asparagus was able to return to his former consulting firm at the same level that he had left at, and he focused on getting back on the fast track with some valuable lessons learned.</p>\n<p>Two years later, Asparagus reentered the job market.  He hadn’t doubled down to make Partner, because he knew he wanted to exit the firm at some point.  So although he was more experienced and a little bit “grayer”, his resume was only attracting attention for the same kind of roles he had looked at three years earlier.  After six months of looking, he had narrowed his options to two key roles.  One was almost exactly the same as the Director offer he had received earlier, but it was with that livestock company’s main competitor.  And his other offer was an SVP position with a startup in the Little Data space.</p>\n<p>Now, what was really sweet about this startup is that Asparagus would be reporting directly to the CEO.  And the CEO only had to meet Asparagus once for 30 minutes before offering him the job, so Asparagus took it as a sign that the CEO recognized his unique talents. The CEO expected a new round of funding to come through any day, and he promised to make the compensation package work for Asparagus. His base salary would be low, but he could earn up to 400% of base in bonus if the company took off.  Details were murky, but Asparagus felt really good about the possible upside.  And frankly, he didn’t want to be a Director at this stage in his career.  He felt that SVP put him back on track and would show everyone how senior he was.  He reached out to Logicus for advice, but the CEO was relentless in getting an answer on the offer. Asparagus only had one night to think about it, and he was afraid of losing the offer.  So he accepted the SVP offer.</p>\n<p>It may sound silly to hear about Asparagus deciding between livestock opportunities, Atlantis, and startups.  But it sounds even sillier to hear people with top MBAs and experience at the premier consulting firms explain similar decisions with their career options.  It happens all of the time.  Some of the consultants we speak with sincerely apologize (yes, apologize) for the decision they are making, and even admit that they know what they are doing sounds crazy.  It’s as though it is out of their control.  Slow down, think strategically, be patient.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Are you Asparagus?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>For more:</strong></p>\n<p>We’ll always have startups | what to consider when considering a startup.</p>\n<p>Untitled: How Significant is the Job Title? | a note on titles, and how much it really affects your career path.</p>\n<p>Great places to be versus great places to be from | how important your next company can be for your career.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

For example, we recently saw a guy choose a Director position with a company that was going nowhere over a Manager role with a very hot company that is quadrupling its revenues this year.  To him, managing dozens of people in a go-nowhere company was better than proving himself with a team of 8 on a rocket ship.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Position: Founder/Partner</p>\n<p>Current Firm: Private Investment Firm</p>\n<p><em>After spending two years at L.E.K pre-MBA, and five years in private equity and investment banking post-MBA, you then returned to consulting and took a role at BCG.  What drove your decision to return to consulting? How do you compare your two consulting experiences?</em></p>\n<p>A couple of things factored into my decision to return to consulting.  On the personal side I had been away from my home town for over 16 years, living and working in six different countries, and I desired to return home.  The BCG role was located in my home town.  From a professional standpoint, BCG had been a partner firm of ours so I knew it well, and I felt some additional consulting experience would help me become a better investor. I liked the way consultants thought, and felt that rolling up my sleeves, digging a bit deeper into industries and corporations, and having more exposure to industries with which I hadn’t worked previously would be of value for my long-term objectives.</p>\n<p>As for my two experiences in consulting at L.E.K and BCG, they were very different, and I was very different, as they were at two separate points in my career.  At L.E.K, I was fresh out of college and the company was growing rapidly – processes were less institutionalized, and my travel was less structured (for example, I would stay in corporate housing and live in different countries for months at a time, whereas at BCG, we had more of the typical Monday through Thursday out-of-office schedule).  In terms of culture, both hire incredibly smart and team oriented people who are intellectually curious and like to solve problems.  As for approach, some have argued that BCG is slightly more intellectual, while L.E.K is more quantitative and implementation focused.</p>\n<p><em>You then left BCG after a year to take a Vice President role at a leading investment bank. Why did you decide to leave BCG when you did, and why for that role in particular? Did you ever consider the Partner path?</em></p>\n<p>I missed doing deals.  There was a particular corporate strategy project at BCG where I essentially conducted a sell side – building the models, identifying the buyers, and doing everything but the execution.  I was also the only person on my team who could do the deal work necessary for that specific assignment at the time.  The engagement was a great success, and it confirmed what type of work really excited me.  Although BCG is an incredible firm, and I considered the Partner path, I did not want to allow my deal and legal skills to atrophy.  A self-professed “tax geek”, I had also put a lot of effort into getting a law degree, and felt that my deal skills and legal experience were not as integrated in consulting as I would have liked in my ideal role.</p>\n<p>As for how I chose my next opportunity, I had worked at that specific investment bank at two other points in my career, and had many mentors at the firm that were still there. Beyond the role itself, I knew it provided a good fit and culture for me personally.</p>\n<p><em>How do you think the combination of your investment banking and consulting experiences makes you competitive? How do you compare the two worlds, and what do you suggest for consultants looking to get into financial services?</em></p>\n<p>Regarding the combination of both consulting and investment banking, the best people in private equity, or advisers in M&amp;A, can think strategically.  They can identify the potential upside and risks and execute the deal.  As I banker, I was able to execute deals as well as think strategically and communicate well like a consultant. These skills allowed me to learn a sector quickly, develop a strategic perspective, identify trends and opportunities, and add even more value as a trusted adviser.</p>\n<p>The two worlds of consulting and investment banking are very different.  Both have very smart people who are incredibly hardworking, but the approach and focus vary widely.  Bankers tend to be more transaction oriented and short-term focused, whereas consultants are more strategic and often have a longer term approach.</p>\n<p>For consultants looking to go into financial services, it really depends on your background and the type of person you are beyond the consultant skill set.  If you are tech-focused or have an engineering background, you are probably best suited for VC, whereas if you have an industry focus and have operational expertise, you may go into private equity on an internal consulting team with the potential to go to the deal side.  If you want to go into I-banking, you need to be comfortable with numbers and different types of valuations, be action and results-oriented, and cannot get stuck on the analysis or in being too theoretical.</p>\n<p>For consultants who want to go into principal investing, there is another difference in mindset. Often consultants take a “glass half full” approach in which they analyze a company, identify issues, and then want to pay for the value they can create by fixing the business.  The best investors have a “glass half empty” approach – they look at a target in terms of what could go wrong, figure out how they could mitigate the risks and maximize returns without paying or overpaying for the value that can be created.</p>\n<p><em>Was investing always a passion of yours, or is it something that developed over time (did you always think you would start your own firm)?</em></p>\n<p>I have always liked going into situations with limited resources and making them into something greater, whether it is at my own firm or at a larger, pre-existing company. I had an idea I would start my own firm, but find excitement in both scenarios.</p>\n<p><em>What skills did you take from consulting specifically (if any) that have made you successful today?</em></p>\n<p>My first consulting experience at L.E.K taught me a quantitative focus, which has been very important in my roles later on within I-banking and private equity. I learned not only how to think strategically, but how to put numbers behind the strategy and the different options we came up with in order to gain confidence in the correct plan to move forward.</p>\n<p>From consulting in general, I honed my communication and presentation skills, which are critical for success in any financial services role. Another differentiating factor is being able to learn an industry or sector quickly, which can be key for advisers.  At the investment bank, I went into an advisory role where I was a sector head and had to learn the industry from scratch.  Thanks to my consulting experience, I was able to landscape the sector and identify key trends, which benefited my clients, and helped me to better align internal resources around deal opportunities.</p>\n<p><em>After L.E.K, you went on to get your JD/MBA from one of the top schools in the country. How do you think the JD/MBA combination has contributed to your later career (if at all) compared with an MBA alone?</em></p>\n<p>My JD has helped quite a bit.  As an investor, I often work with accountants, attorneys, consultants, etc.  My understanding of legal frameworks and what is critical in the deal process allows me to manage the process more efficiently – I can readily determine what is important, how long a task should take to complete, and can draft language myself to move a deal forward if needed.  My understanding of tax specifically has also allowed me to go toe-to-toe with those who are more senior because I can assess the transaction structure from a tax perspective to optimize returns or maximize corporate flexibility.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Position: Global Head of Procurement</p>\n<p>Current Firm: QBE Insurance</p>\n<p>*At the time of this interview Jamie was the Chief Procurement Officer of the Australia Post.</p>\n<p><em>After spending seven years at A.T. Kearney, you left as a Principal for a Managing Director role at a Fortune 300 insurance broker. Why did you decide to leave when you did, and why for that role in particular?  Did you ever consider the Partner path?</em></p>\n<p>It was a combination of factors.  From the time I joined ATK in the mid-1990s, I was definitely moving along the career route to Partner, and really enjoyed both the culture of ATK and the challenge of consulting as a career.  By late 2001, however, it was clear that the EDS parent relationship with ATK was not working and there was no actual “Partner path” to aspire to, as ATK was no longer operating as a true partnership under EDS.  The net result was that talent was leaving the firm and the culture was starting to erode.  Had the eventual buyout of ATK by its Partners happened sooner, it may have impacted my decision to leave.  I keep in frequent contact with some of my old colleagues and it is great to see the firm thriving again back in a traditional partnership structure.   In any case, whether you are on the Partner path or not, you never know when opportunities will surface and, as they come along, you assess each by its own merits. When an opportunity arose to start a strategic planning function within a blue chip insurance broker, I was attracted to the idea of a startup organization within a larger company platform.  Combined with the situation at ATK, it also provided a more flexible path for growth compared with other opportunities I was considering, and I decided it was the best move for me at the time.</p>\n<p><em>Leaving ATK as a Principal, what advice do you have for consultants looking to leave at a similar level?</em></p>\n<p>Consulting is a great profession that gives you the opportunity to work in teams with very smart people to solve complex problems across a variety of companies and industries.  Leaving lifestyle issues aside which I think are well documented, the only real downside is that, as a consultant, you only really recommend solutions, you don’t get to own the actual decision and next steps. The key attraction of moving out of consulting into industry for me was the opportunity to take on line management responsibility and to take ownership of decisions.  But everyone will have their own different reasons for considering a career change.  My advice to anyone looking to leave consulting is to understand what the change is you are really looking for – this will help you truly assess whether any specific opportunity is the right one for you.  Sometimes the best decisions are the moves you don’t make.</p>\n<p><em>You went into the internal corporate strategy group in your first post-consulting role, and had some large, high-level projects including a Chief of Staff role for a multi-billion dollar merger. Can you expand on that transition? How did your experience on the inside compare to external consulting?</em></p>\n<p>Strategy roles in industry offer many of the same challenges and dynamics as consulting, which made the transition fairly seamless in my experience. The difference is in the opportunity for growth provided by the internal roles, where the strategic planning function can offer a platform to transition into line management.   Another difference is in how you manage and interact with stakeholders, which are much more permanent when you are sitting inside an organization.  In consulting, your internal reporting relationships tend to change with every assignment, as well as the sets of stakeholders you have to navigate, as every new client, or new project with an existing client, presents a different set of relationships to manage.  Moving into an industry role does not typically present that type of flexibility.</p>\n<p><em>For consultants going into internal corporate strategy roles, any tips on how they can hit the ground running / make the most impact?</em></p>\n<p>For me it was really no different than hitting the ground running on a consulting engagement.  You need to build relationships with the key stakeholders, understand what represents value to them, and then deliver against that.  At the end of the day, it’s not complicated: you succeed or fail based on how you deliver against the expectations of the stakeholders you serve.</p>\n<p><em>Spending most of your career in advisory firms, you then moved to become Chief Procurement Officer for Australia Post. How did you choose to take on that role, and was the transition like? What have you found to be the major differences / challenges?</em></p>\n<p>I must confess, most of my friends laughed when I told them I was moving continents to go work at “the post office”, but the reality is Australia Post is a true cultural icon in Australia, going through what is currently the largest and most complex transformation in Australia. So the opportunity, aside from offering me the chance to reconnect with my family and friends after many years living in the United States, was really quite a unique one for a restructuring professional. Launched in April 2010, Future Ready is a five-year business renewal program transforming Australia Post into a more customer-focused and sustainable organization, which embraces the digital world. Our Future Ready strategy is focused on restoring a self-sustaining letters business, growing our parcels business and building a multi-channel services offering in digital retail. As the CPO, I work across the enterprise to drive the best possible commercial outcomes, and as a member of the Finance &amp; Business Services leadership team I’m also involved in delivering a broad range of activities to ensure the enterprise programs and projects are executed in the most efficient and cost-effective way. As in most business transformations, the goal posts are constantly shifting, and time is the enemy, so the environment is both challenging and stimulating.</p>\n<p><em>You’ve made a practice of restructuring and creating teams within organizations to impact the bottom line. Having just built a procurement team for your current organization, how do you compare it to your previous experiences? What do you think are the essential elements to drive change in an organization?</em></p>\n<p>Every experience is different, but the key elements of driving successful change remain the same. At Australia Post we are focused on ensuring we have the right culture to execute our strategy. You need to surround yourself with talented people who behave in the right ways, have a clear strategy and plan of action, and are supported by good systems and processes, to achieve positive outcomes. You have to be able to measure progress along the way, with a focus on rewarding success and managing consequences.</p>\n<p><em>What would you say is the most important skill that has gotten you where you are today? What did you take specifically from consulting that makes you successful in your job now?</em></p>\n<p>I think it comes down to being able to understand and navigate through different stakeholder priorities and agendas, knowing when to compromise and when to stand your ground, and being able to find the right middle ground to deliver what often, in retrospect, turn out to be “common sense” solutions. In addition, you need to accept that you won’t always have perfect information to make decisions: a good plan executed now is nearly always better than a perfect plan executed later.</p>\n<p><em>You’ve worked in three different continents throughout your career. How has that affected your professional outlook, and what importance do you give international experience when evaluating an executive?</em></p>\n<p>I haven’t ruled out working in four! I think international experience certainly gives you greater exposure to different perspectives, but at the end of the day, these are often intangible. In my experience, being geographically flexible has opened many more opportunities for professional development and personal growth.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Position: Managing Director</p>\n<p>Current Firm: Vista Consulting Group</p>\n<p>*At the time of this interview Jeremy was the Senior Vice President of Operations at McKesson Corporation.</p>\n<p><em>Going back to your pre-consulting career, you spent seven years in operations roles, ending at GE Capital before going to business school. How did that pre-MBA experience affect your post-MBA career?</em></p>\n<p>My post-undergraduate, pre-MBA experience involved roles across four countries at two different firms – Barry Blau &amp; Partners, a “small” but global marketing agency, and large blue-chip firm GE Capital. These experiences affected my post-MBA career in the following ways:</p>\n<p>1) GE&#8217;s employer brand contributed to my ability to secure each of my post-MBA interview opportunities.</p>\n<p>2) The skills I developed through my pre-MBA training at General Electric in Six Sigma, change management, and general management enabled me to improve my success probability in my post-MBA career.</p>\n<p>3) My pre-MBA experience in acquisition integration opened up an opportunity to lead one of the largest integrations in company history at McKesson just a year after I joined. Successful execution of that project opened further career doors at the company.</p>\n<p>4) Moving across multiple roles and countries before business school, I learned the need to be flexible and open to new opportunities and geographies. Generally, you have to go where the job is. Many people aren’t open to relocation, but you have to be willing to move if you want to capture the new, great opportunity. Importantly, this expectation also needs to be accepted by your spouse / family. For me personally, I don’t and can’t make career decisions in a vacuum.</p>\n<p><em>After two years at Bain, you then returned to General Electric in its healthcare division. What made you decide to leave Bain when you did, and why for that role in particular? Did you ever consider the Partner path?</em></p>\n<p>One of my motivations to apply to business school was to change my industry career path, as I didn’t have a personal connection to my current industry (financial services). At Harvard, I researched many industries and chose healthcare as my course. After conferring with several alumni and professors, I concluded that consulting was the best route after business school to learn about the various healthcare segments (pharma, medical devices, providers, etc.). Within the healthcare industry, there isn’t a lot of crossover, (i.e. you don’t see device firms recruiting pharma folks and vice versa), so I wanted to understand each of the industry segments before committing to one in particular.</p>\n<p>When I joined Bain, the economy crashed and limited the pipeline of healthcare projects, and after a period I decided to look at opportunities in industry to gain more exposure. The opportunities could be grouped in two categories – device firms and pharmaceutical firms – and I chose the device route as I lacked the scientific background / pedigree required by most pharma firms at the time. From there, I chose GE from my previous knowledge / experience with the company and conversations with my network contacts, as well as the potential opportunity to redefine a Six Sigma swat team under a boss I respected and with whom I wanted to work.</p>\n<p>In terms of the Partner path, I never considered it when I interviewed with Bain. My motivation to enter consulting was for exposure to the healthcare industry and acquisition of a top-tier consulting toolkit. I enjoy solving a problem as well as implementing the solution, whereas the latter step is lacking in the work of most strategy consultants.</p>\n<p><em>Has healthcare always been an interest of yours, or was it more a product of circumstance? What do you suggest for consultants looking to get into the space?</em></p>\n<p>I developed an interest in and commitment to the healthcare industry while at HBS. As a first step for consultants looking to get into the space, I advise reading reports from investment banking analysts and research firms (e.g. S&amp;P, Frost &amp; Sullivan), and speaking with b-school and consulting firm alumni to understand the industry dynamics domestically and globally. Thereafter, pick the space (e.g. pharma, biotech, insurance, devices, etc.) in which you want to play and then initiate the job search. As you uncover opportunities, research the heck out of the firm with which you’ll interview.</p>\n<p>Despite my lack of healthcare industry experience, I got my job after Bain by doing my homework. I read every report I could about the industry niche of the job for which I applied. My last interview with the General Manager of GE Healthcare was scheduled for 45 minutes, and we spoke for 2 1/2 hours discussing competitor dynamics, industry trends, the profit pool, etc. I got a job offer that evening, and the same phenomenon happened during my interview with McKesson. Knowledge is power.</p>\n<p><em>Having returned to operational improvement in your first post-consulting role at General Electric, what (if anything) did you gain from your consulting experience?</em></p>\n<p>Bain taught me two lessons that I applied in my first post-consulting role and in which I currently train my staff. First, the Pyramid Principle: as soon as possible, define the problem statement, clarify the key questions to answer, develop hypotheses, craft tight, data-based arguments, and build your work plan based on the hypotheses. This method employs the “pyramid principle” approach developed by Barbara Minto in the early 1970s. Second is executive presentation. Create slide decks with clear messages and supporting evidence – whether textual or graphical – in simple, clear, compelling ways. If a slide can’t be digested and understood in seconds, it’s too complex.</p>\n<p><em>You then moved from GE to a role in McKesson’s internal strategy group. How did internal strategy compare to your experience in consulting at Bain?</em></p>\n<p>Internal company strategy groups are not training grounds – you’re expected to have the required skill sets and to work independently. You may also not have the same research resources readily available to you, and will have to find them and argue to fund them (e.g. report access). Unlike large, top-tier consulting firms, internal strategy groups don’t have research departments at their disposal.</p>\n<p>Importantly, you’ll be expected to do more with less, as corporate strategy groups are often small. When you’re assigned a problem to solve, you may not have a team behind you to execute the work – you will be the Analyst, Consultant, and Engagement Manager all at once. Plan and set execution expectations accordingly, and be prepared to roll up your sleeves again.</p>\n<p>Lastly, in an internal strategy group, you may manage the work of external consulting teams because you will need extra people for the larger projects. The consulting firm will rely on you to be its window into the company to clarify the problem statement, navigate within the company, provide access to required data, perform gut check analysis, and understand internal culture / politics. The relationship between you and the consulting firm Engagement Manager and Principal will be symbiotic.</p>\n<p><em>Having gone between strategy and operations throughout your career, what was your thought process in stacking the two? How has that combination affected your track, and where do you see yourself down the line in terms of professional growth and development?</em></p>\n<p>My pre-MBA roles were heavily operational. During that time, my appreciation for strategy grew, and I sought to develop a sound toolkit in the discipline. This led to my decisions to apply to MBA schools that were strong in the strategy discipline; to join Bain after graduation; and to take a role in an internal strategy group.</p>\n<p>The majority of roles in industry are operationally oriented, however, a handful of people work in corporate strategy groups – hundreds / thousands of people work in the business to develop products and services, sell and market them, and deliver them. In my observation, general management opportunities are more open to those possessing deep, diverse operating experience, which is the function I ultimately aspire to move into down the line.</p>\n<p><em>As Senior Vice President of Operations for a leading Fortune 100 healthcare company, what are some of the largest challenges of your current role? What do you find most exciting?</em></p>\n<p>The U.S. healthcare cost structure is in a troubled state. Over 18% of GDP is spent on healthcare (more than any other industrialized nation). With an aging population, this rate is increasingly unsustainable. We have to find ways to reverse this trend – it reduces our global competitiveness, strains our societal fabric, and adversely impacts our nation’s cost structure.</p>\n<p>A large part of my role involves identifying and pursuing ways to reduce our company cost structure and deliver our goods and services to our customers more efficiently and effectively. My division’s customers (U.S. hospitals) are under constant cost pressure with declining reimbursement and thin operating margins. Our market (healthcare IT) is also very competitive.</p>\n<p>The excitement in my role comes from complex business problems involving strategy, organization, process, IT, and finance aspects. My team and I have to define the problem statement, reach consensus on it, determine and sell the “answer”, and then implement our solution. The challenges are not only intellectual, but also interpersonal (e.g. change management). No solutions can be force-fed to our internal customers – buy-in is required, as a “perfect” solution without acceptance will ultimately fail. Naturally, there are frustrations with every project, but when we’ve completed implementation and see results, the satisfaction is sweet.</p>\n<p><em>Having worked internationally in your pre-consulting career, how has that affected your career and professional outlook today (if at all)? What importance do you give international experience when evaluating an executive?</em></p>\n<p>My international experience forced maturity and professional acceleration, opened my interest to opportunities inside and outside the U.S., and framed my business “world view” to think on a global level. I suspect it has made my resume more attractive to recruiters as well.</p>\n<p>That said, the importance that firms place on international experience will vary. Firms with significant international operations or which aspire to grow internationally will value the experience, while those that are domestically-oriented will not. If you do want to work in an international role with a U.S.-based company, you should consider that such a role may involve significant travel, requiring a lifestyle trade-off.</p>\n<p>In my current role, I would appreciate international experience in a candidate for my team, but it wouldn’t be a deciding factor because the scope of my role / team is domestically-oriented. Factors related to the specific job carry greater weight. If my scope included international operations, however, my priorities would change.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Position: Chief Executive Officer</p>\n<p>Current Firm: SteelSeries</p>\n<p><em>You stayed in consulting for four years at McKinsey with a focus on tech and telecom projects before moving into a Senior Director role within Motorola&#8217;s Strategy Group. Can you describe your thought process and experience during that transition from consulting? Any advice you would give members who are considering a similar move? And why did you leave after four years rather than two, three, or six?</em></p>\n<p>There were really two things that went into the decision to transition when I did. The first was ultimately moving from strategy to operations, which really was a culmination of my experience so far going from operations to B school, then to broader strategy at McKinsey with projects every month across different industries. It was time to go back and really run something. The second, which ended up not being as true, was that I wanted to travel less because we had just had our second child. Most consultants think that moving to corporate means less travel, and that’s not the case most of the time – I didn’t have less, but I certainly had more control over it than I did in consulting.</p>\n<p>As for my thought process in terms of where I chose to go, it was a combination of factors. I knew I liked the industry, and the role had a good path that matched my objectives. I had also happened to work with that company on some projects with McKinsey. Having that outside, elevated perspective really helped me recognize the hidden opportunities and commitment to change they had at the senior-most levels of the company.</p>\n<p>Something I do think is very important for consultants who eventually want an operations role is to voice that goal from day one of your conversations with your future employer. Although I went into a strategy role to get my foot in the door, I made it clear that I wanted to move on to operations and set a time limit with my employer for when that move would take place. Some things got changed around, of course, and the path didn’t happen exactly as planned, but I got where I wanted to go eventually.</p>\n<p><em>Did you ever consider the Partner path in consulting?</em></p>\n<p>I probably considered it at some point. My decision goes back to my personal desire to be in a more operational role. At McKinsey, though, I had only planned to stay for two years and ended up staying for four – time flies when you’re doing that kind of thing. McKinsey also gives you a lot of time to step back, reflect, and really feel out what you want, which was helpful.</p>\n<p><em>A lot of our visitors want to jump right into a P&amp;L role as they leave consulting, and they pass on corporate strategy roles with the hopes of securing GM jobs. Do you have any thoughts on this approach?</em></p>\n<p>I don’t think there’s really a right or wrong answer here – it’s more of a personal and situational decision. If you can get into an operational role right away with the right kind of senior level support structure, then that’s definitely a way to go. For me, joining in a strategy role worked in my favor because there were a lot of senior level management changes at the time &#8211; it was the kind of interfacing role where I could have a hand in the transition, and it allowed me to develop a great network that expanded my internal opportunities in the future.</p>\n<p><em>You are currently the CEO of a global, high growth company – a dream job for many, especially current and former consultants. Do you feel that your prior “large company” experience was critical in your selection as CEO of SteelSeries? How influential has that “large co” experience been to your success in your current role, or would you go back and do anything differently in your career path?</em></p>\n<p>My large company experience was very important to me personally, but I caution that statement because it’s not to say that you can’t get in at the ground level and ride with a PayPal or something to that effect – then you’ll do well regardless. So in speaking to my experience, there were numerous aspects of working at a large company that had a critical impact on where I am today. The first was the network I developed, through which I actually landed my current role. That network also allowed me to quickly make an impact as the new CEO at SteelSeries, because while it wasn’t in the exact same space, I knew the players to the extent that I could rapidly build a network around our products.</p>\n<p>The second benefit of my large company experience was knowing what the future looks like, something I learned from leading a successful, growing unit at a large and stable company. In those roles and businesses you regularly look into the future, and you know what success looks like – it’s something that really transformed my thinking and allows me to do so at my company today. The third has to do with the network again, in that you surround yourself with talented people. I’ve hired a lot of people from my old company, and they have introduced me to others of the same caliber.</p>\n<p><em>What are your thoughts on the importance of gaining global / international experience?</em></p>\n<p>Again, this is a personal belief, but I feel as though when you lack international experience you are left a bit more underdeveloped than you would be otherwise. My company operates on a “Think global, act local” mantra, and the leveraged learning you get from understanding economies of scale, etc., is key to what we do. To really be leaders nowadays, I think you have to take it global.</p>\n<p><em>Having grown SteelSeries in this challenging economy, what advice could you give our visitors about the lessons you have learned along the way?</em></p>\n<p>In general – and I don’t think I’m a novel thinker by any means – I am a believer that there is always growth. Typically when people identify a decline in an industry it’s because the numbers are down across the major players – but that’s because those major players are all playing the game the same way. You have to take into consideration what you have and be willing to change the game. I was lucky in that I came into a small space where we had room to grow with new accounts, new channels, new geographies, new product lines, etc., but if we had just built off of what we were, there would have been no room for improvement.</p>\n<p><em>What do you find most exciting about the technology / gaming industry?</em></p>\n<p>I’ll point to two things that definitely get me excited, the first being the move of gaming to mobile because that’s where I have a lot of experience. The second is that for the technology industry as a whole, I really like the rapid change and pace of consumer products. There are some areas like enterprise sales that can take two or three years to play out, but I’m much more drawn to the fast changing technology connected with the consumer.</p>\n<p><em>Which of the skills that you gained in consulting has added the most value in your work life?</em></p>\n<p>For sure I think there are things that I’ve taken from consulting that lead to success in the work environment. The biggest is being able to take a large, nebulous problem and work with a team to break it down into definable actions. On top of that, it’s the ability to spread that problem-solving to others in your team so you can elevate the whole. A third is being able to quickly communicate with senior executives both within and outside your company – you become a great resource because you can convince senior management to act on your recommendations.</p>\n<p><em>What is the coolest job you have seen a consultant / former colleague move into?</em></p>\n<p>For a sports fan, one of my classmates at McKinsey had an offer to be like Billy Beane from Moneyball and analyze players based on stats, with a shot at becoming General Manager at a major team. He didn’t end up taking the job, but I think that’s also a part of the coolness: the options that are opened to us from being in consulting as well.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Position: VP, Enterprise Product Solutions</p>\n<p>Current Firm: Cigna</p>\n<p>*At the time of this interview Aneesh was the Head of Consumer Engagement Strategy for Aetna Inc.</p>\n<p><em>After three years at Accenture, you left as a Project Manager for an Engagement Manager role at Booz. For our readers considering a transition, why the switch between two strategy firms? How did that move translate (if at all) to your later corporate career?</em></p>\n<p>My primary reason for leaving was a change of focus from technology to business strategy. At Accenture, I was doing a lot of large system transformation projects, and gained a perspective on large-scale work – frequently leading 30-40 person teams, working across countries. When I went to Booz, I dealt with problems that had much less structure to them, and gained an understanding of the “bigger picture” through questions of strategic stance and market entry. My Accenture experience, interestingly, was a clear advantage at Booz. It is becoming rarer to find “pure strategy” work, as more and more strategy consultancies are adding operational components to their offerings. In the end, it was my combination of experiences with the larger-scale, focused work in tandem with a broader understanding of business issues that proved valuable to clients.</p>\n<p><em>You then left Booz after two years to become Vice President of Corporate Strategy for Aetna, a Fortune 100 health services company. Having worked in corporate previously, what motivated you to return to the industry? What factors did you consider in choosing that particular opportunity over others?</em></p>\n<p>I want to preface my comments by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Booz. In taking the opportunity at Aetna, three factors came into play: 1) healthcare was, and still is, at a major crossroads, and I had identified the company as one of the few that could create a meaningful difference in the industry moving forward, 2) the opportunity provided a better work / life balance (although it is certainly not an 8-to-5 job), and 3) the role was as close as you can get to strategy consulting within a company, which at the core is something I still very much enjoy whether outside or inside an organization.</p>\n<p>At the time I took my offer I was considering a few other opportunities, and chose my current company and role because it fulfilled my main criteria. Looking at the types of people who worked there, I knew I would continue to be surrounded by smart, driven individuals in a forward-looking company and culture that was open to new ideas. From a logistical perspective, it also allowed for more control over my schedule and travel, and I did not have to relocate from where I was living at the time. Finally, the role would give me unparalleled insight into the critical questions facing a major player in the industry.</p>\n<p><em>Leaving consulting at the Engagement Manager level, what kinds of positions were you targeting? What advice would you give consultants who are looking to transition at a similar level?</em></p>\n<p>Most Engagement Managers will likely come in at the Director or Senior Director level – in my experience, I leveraged my previous roles in industry to come in as a Vice President. In consulting, you’re trained to think at the executive level, which helps many consultants to fulfill the more senior roles. My advice would be to look at the role itself more than the title, which is purely a function of the company’s size and other more general factors. You want to focus on what kind of impact the role has on senior decision making, and if it has access to senior management.</p>\n<p><em>In your move from external consulting to the internal strategy team at Aetna, what have you found to be the main similarities and differences of the two?</em></p>\n<p>The outside-in, hypothesis-driven-approach is the same in both internal and external consulting. That said, there are a couple of key differences. The first is that once you’re in, your recommendations do not stop at the PowerPoint presentation – you are around for the implementation stage (or lack thereof!). Your value to the company becomes tied to whether your recommendations are actually put into action, so you have to be incredibly sensitive to whether your proposals can really work, and make sure you gain buy-in from senior leaders in the beginning as well as throughout the process. Another difference is that, for better or worse, all of your projects are for one, single client. You gain a much better understanding of the business, but it may not be as fulfilling for someone who is looking for a wide variety of projects.</p>\n<p>Overall, many of my colleagues from consulting think of their transition to internal strategy – all things considered – as a very positive move.</p>\n<p><em>With many ex-consultants at your company today, do you have any advice about the pitfalls current consultants should watch out for in the interview process? In the transition to corporate itself?</em></p>\n<p>To be blunt, I think part of it has to do with hubris. Coming from strategy, many consultants presume that corporate “lifers” are oblivious to the inefficiencies and inconsistencies of the healthcare industry. They’re not. And it is not for lack of analysis, ability, or effort that the industry still has many of its problems today. Healthcare is incredibly complex, and once you get past the “lifer” assumption, you realize how much there is to learn in an industry that is highly regulated and where the financial and societal impact is high. My advice is to combine your outside knowledge with humility in order to absorb the vast amount of information from those who know it firsthand.</p>\n<p>In looking at prospective employers, consultants should also be aware of how the senior management team is constituted to assess where they can add the most value. A company that frequently goes outside for talent will provide a more eclectic atmosphere for growth with people from different companies, industries, and backgrounds, whereas a company where executives come primarily from the inside will tend to have more insular strategy / management.</p>\n<p><em>You founded a startup just before Accenture, and have since worked in strategy consulting and at a Fortune 100 company. Do you think you would go about a startup any differently now with your additional consulting / corporate experiences? </em></p>\n<p>Absolutely. Consulting really makes you “grow up,” in that it gives you a new, broader perspective on the factors that impact a business. With my consulting experience, if I did my startup (running an outpatient therapy / rehabilitation center) again, I would be less technology-driven, while focusing more on customer acquisition efficiency and on partnerships.</p>\n<p><em>You have had an industry focus on healthcare for much of your career. As a strategist for Aetna, a major player, what do you find most exciting about it? What advice do you have for consultants looking to get into the space?</em></p>\n<p>To me, there is nothing more satisfying than helping people live healthier lives. On the business side, it’s also an industry full of large, complex problems, and there is always high demand for strategic thinkers and problem solvers. For consultants who want to get into the space, they should start by focusing on understanding the economic models of the various healthcare players. There is no doubt that the industry is inefficient, but they should know it is not because people haven’t thought of the solutions. At the core, the incentive structures and regulatory barriers negate an easy answer or set of answers. Once they understand that concept and adjust their approach, it can be a lot of fun.</p>\n<p><em>What skills / experiences do you think have made you successful in your career?</em></p>\n<p>I think the most important attribute has been intellectual curiosity, and a willingness / openness to try new things. I’ve enjoyed many roles throughout my career, from software product management, to founding / managing a startup, to strategy consulting and now corporate strategy. As a consultant, you already have a great work ethic – if you pair it with intellectual curiosity, it can make for a great career.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p class=\"profile-intro\">Position: Business Unit President</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">Current Firm: Medical Device Manufacturer</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"> <em>After a business-focused undergrad program, you spent 10 years in corporate at a “Big Three” automotive company.  How did that pre-MBA experience affect your post-MBA career?</em></p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">After 10 years of being on the fast track in an academy company, I realized it would take longer than I liked to get the big P&amp;L responsibility, and on top of that, I could see some of the writing on the wall for the automotive industry’s upcoming challenges. I left corporate with some of my colleagues to start a consulting firm focused on private equity, with a business model of applying our tools from automotive (time to market, lean manufacturing, and the basic things to transform a business) to other industries that had big margins but were lacking the same operating expertise.  I did that for three years, and ended up subcontracting with AlixPartners, which at the time was starting a management consulting arm in the restructuring business focused on serving PE firms.</p>\n<p>I do want to take a minute to point out that there is a very clear, fundamental difference between private equity consulting (what I did) and strategy consulting. My time at Alix was spent almost entirely in PE and restructuring, which are similar in that they both have the sense of urgency, and focus on immediacy and the most important problem. I did one singular gig in strategy and hated it, and knew it was something I was not interested in going forward.</p>\n<p><em>After five years at AlixPartners, you left to join a leading private equity firm.  What factors did you consider in choosing that particular opportunity?</em></p>\n<p>I had contacts at the private equity firm I eventually joined, and was attracted to it because it had a lot of depth in operations capability. For my transition out of consulting, I considered smaller shops as well, but decided against the opportunity to play a more central role at those firms in exchange for a steeper learning curve and exposure to the very senior, experienced, and talented people I knew at the firm I eventually joined.</p>\n<p>For consultants looking to transition, I’ve seen a lot of people want to jump to the more senior roles in corporate without putting in the time to prepare for them. It’s better to switch out of consulting early enough so that your expectations aren’t too high, because going into a VP-level role straight from consulting can be too much of a jump at that transition point.</p>\n<p><em>For folks looking to make that move, what are your thoughts on targeting smaller shops to get the mix of investment and operations experience?  As a true operator, do you have any advice on the pitfalls?</em></p>\n<p>Two things here. The first is that going to a smaller shop as an operator is still a great thing – I love the flexibility gained from the exposure you get in those firms. The second, and more general point, is that for consultants who take the route of going straight into private equity, there is the challenge (not so much a “pitfall”) of being deal savvy. Private equity is very different from management consulting in that it is absolutely results oriented – you need to have the finance chops with the P&amp;L and balance sheet to convert to an underwritten investment thesis and carefully measure it every day. You need to connect the theories to the business realities and financial statements, and that is where some consultants might get into trouble.</p>\n<p><em>For those who don’t have the deal mindset you just described, but still have the goal of a private equity career, what do you suggest they do to make themselves more attractive for a PE opportunity?</em></p>\n<p>See if you can get yourself into the private equity space. You can get credit in a PE situation even if you’re doing strategy – I’ve taught a lot of McKinsey guys on my team who didn’t come ready with everything. The next step would be to jump to an academy company to get a deep spike, or into restructuring which is another good way to demonstrate results. Again, it’s about showing you can be results-oriented. When you’re interviewing with a private equity firm, you have to be able to say, &#8220;This is what the P&amp;L looked like before I was there, and this is what it was after.&#8221; You need to be able to speak their language.</p>\n<p><em>Should people pursue private equity because of the money?</em></p>\n<p>Not exclusively – money can come from a lot of places. In private equity, if you love the idea of being an owner, the money will come, but if you can’t wake up every morning and feel like it’s your money on the line, then it won’t. I’ve seen a lot of people go into private equity who don’t make any money. You have to start with the right DNA and set of skills to make it successful.</p>\n<p><em>What advice do you have for consultants who are just beginning in private equity?</em></p>\n<p>My fundamental belief is that you need time on the client site to gain credibility. Consultants, more than the deal guys, are trained to recognize gaps in management competencies, and are therefore better able to flag those issues as of value. It’s an important skill to bring to the table, but in order to do so, you need to have built in the credibility from your engagement on the client site to make and recommend those changes.</p>\n<p>I would also say that you need to be very aware, at all times, of your ability to draw a clear connection between your efforts and the bottom line impact. If you spend 15 minutes doing something that doesn’t make that connection, the private equity folks won’t appreciate it.</p>\n<p><em>Having held senior-level roles at both AlixPartners and your subsequent PE firm, how do you compare the two? How was the transition for you?</em></p>\n<p>Compared with consulting, the focus on the deal economics in private equity is paramount – any action or time spent must have linkage to the economics / portfolio. A second difference is in how you must communicate your message, because there is a broader audience than just the executive team like in consulting. You need to be able to communicate with the board as well as company management, and to be able to interface and manage across both levels.</p>\n<p>A similarity between AlixPartners and private equity is in the transition – the key is to figure out how the game is played in both scenarios. Find the questions you need to ask in order to get the answers you need, and find the people you can trust to be your mentors and show you the nuances. For my transition, I personally had an easy time switching over – I was also overseeing field operations people, which is easier than immediately interfacing with the deal team. In that type of role, no one expects you to know the deal / ops team dynamics, and in that sense it is an easier role for folks coming straight from consulting. It’s a great way to ease the transition and have time to gain the deal experience.</p>\n<p><em>You’ve lived the dream of many consultants, going from the operational side of private equity to a business unit President role in a PE portfolio company. How did you pull it off? How did you decide to take on that particular role, and what’s it like being on the other side of the table?</em></p>\n<p>I was the Operations Partner for my current company, so it was very much my deal – I did the due diligence, worked on the transformation, and traveled to and from the site each week. I’ve been traveling close to 100% of the time for most of my career, and even with that experience, this was a lot of travel for me. With the ground time and $100mn worth of cost reduction, I had developed a good relationship with the CEO, and was helping to assess candidates for the President role of the business unit. He kept asking me why I didn’t take it myself, and through the process, I realized I ultimately wanted to go back into corporate. In private equity, you always know that when the right deal comes along you can transform and go back into industry.</p>\n<p><em>You’ve worked with medical devices and services throughout your career in consulting, PE, and now as a business unit President at a leading medical products company. Has that industry always been an interest of yours, or is it something that developed over time?</em></p>\n<p>The appeal of the medical devices industry was that it was high margin to start, and there were a lot of levers that hadn’t been pulled that I knew how to pull from my days in the automotive industry. Innovation is key in this industry, and that’s where my focus has shifted – from cost reduction to revenue growth. There are a lot of industries that have had that shift, and I find the companies that have a short development cycle and a lot of R&amp;D spend to be the most exciting.</p>\n<p><em>For consultants, do you think being industry agnostic is OK, or should they apply some rationale?</em></p>\n<p>Early on it helps to bring a depth of industry knowledge from consulting, and over time you earn the right to apply pattern recognition / experience to different industries and drivers. Beyond that, it is vital to get out and placed to gain credibility, because the management team will always want someone with a great track record whom they feel they can trust. You either have to have major wins in a deep spike of function (where you can get away with being an industry generalist), or have a deep spike in industry, in order to be successful.</p>\n<p>For me, my deep spike was in lean manufacturing from automotive. In my current industry, where there is a focus on innovation, you don’t get the right to work on that stuff until you have your foot in the door and the wins to prove your worth.</p>\n<p><em>You’ve gone full circle in your career, from corporate, to consulting, to PE, and now back to corporate as a Business Unit President. What are your plans in terms of personal development and growth in the future? Do you see yourself in corporate for the long term?</em></p>\n<p>I think self-awareness is key to be able to identify your opportunities. I also believe in continuous improvement, and that you never reach a level at which you cannot better yourself. In addition to the leadership of my current company, I find coaches in external groups, and actively network and join associations to expand my circle.</p>\n<p>As for where I’ll end up in the future, I will likely finish out my career in or around private equity. I love the pace of the industry compared to most corporations.</p>\n<p><em>Finally, anything else you can share about how you have approached the defining transition points in your career? Who is on your personal Board of Directors (the coaches, mentors, etc. that you mentioned previously)?</em></p>\n<p>I have mentors from every step of my career whom I consult on a regular basis, and the issues themselves really define the group I go to in particular. I still have close friends from my first 10 years in corporate, as well as from AlixPartners, and my recent private equity firm. The concept of the network is absolutely critical in looking at those next steps in your career – you never want to burn a bridge, because the world is getting smaller and smaller. I always make time for developing people, and getting developed, because I believe those are some of the most important aspects of the job.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p class=\"profile-intro\">Position: General Manager</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">Current Firm: LAN Airlines</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">*At the time of this interview Luis held the role of Vice President, Handling Operations at LAN Airlines</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>Going back to your pre-MBA career, you did a stint at Bain and left for a role at Carrefour, a multi-billion dollar retail company. What made you decide to go back to consulting post-MBA?</em></p>\n<p>It’s an interesting story, because when I left Bain I promised myself I would never go back into consulting, which is not a reflection on the firm itself, but more one of my specific circumstances.  I liked the work, and found it to be extremely interesting, but I started in a new office that still needed to establish itself, and in a market that was not used to consulting pricing at the time.  As a result, we worked with understaffed teams, which made the lifestyle unsustainable. In business school I had a few friends who convinced me that consulting was different in the U.S., and because I liked the basics of the work, I decided to give it another shot – the worst that could happen was if I didn’t like it, I would leave after a year or so.  I loved Booz, and ended up staying at the firm for much longer than expected.</p>\n<p><em>After spending almost seven years at Booz, you left the firm as a Principal to go back into industry at Wal-Mart as Senior Director of Strategic Planning for Latin America. Why did you decide to leave Booz when you did, and why for that role in particular?</em></p>\n<p>Going back to the industry was my plan since I joined Booz. I was doing well in consulting, and truth be told, I got too comfortable – I was really only passively looking until two years into Principal, when this opportunity showed up and I knew I had to make the decision of whether I would push for Partner. When you’re at Partner level, you’re really in consulting for the long-haul, and when I asked myself if it was what I wanted, the honest answer was “no.” Consulting was great, and I loved the people, but it was not something I desired long-term.</p>\n<p>As for the role I chose to take at Wal-Mart, it was an exciting opportunity for a couple of reasons. It was a very large company, but the Latin America office was smaller and offered an entrepreneurial environment, and that combination really appealed to me. The role also broadened my international experience, and exposed me to the whole of Latin America rather than the few places I knew from consulting and my Brazilian background. It was a tough decision, and I spoke with a lot of the Partners about the pros and cons – in the end, I decided it was the move for me.</p>\n<p><em>For your transition back into corporate, what was it like going from external to internal strategy? How was your transition into corporate different than that of you pre-MBA experience?</em></p>\n<p>It was a very different experience.  Pre-MBA, I went from consulting into a line role, which was exactly what I wanted to do and I knew what to expect.  In that sense, the pre-MBA transition was relatively easy, whereas the one from Booz into internal strategy was more of a learning curve. Internal strategy has its pros and cons. For pros, you never leave a project behind, and get to bring the suggestions, analogies, and recommendations from consulting through to implementation.  You check in with all of the groups / international teams to make sure it is being done correctly, you follow-up, and get to factor in the budgeting process and long-term planning.  For cons, it is actually much harder to push change, which might seem counterintuitive considering internal strategy lies within the actual organization.  The sense of urgency from an external project is lost on an internal team.  Internal teams are on an annual salary and are in the office regardless, whereas external consultants can be staffed for just a few weeks at a time, there is a lot of money involved, and you have access to top management in order to get done what you need.</p>\n<p><em>From your strategy role at Wal-Mart, you left retail to move into your current role as a Vice President of Handling Operations for LAN Airlines, a leading air cargo operator, with a P&amp;L of over $300mn and over 3,000 direct reports. How did your previous internal strategy experience help prepare you for your subsequent operations role? What have been some of the challenges, and do you have any suggestions for consultants who are targeting a P&amp;L role in the future?</em></p>\n<p>The move itself wasn’t something I had initially planned. My current company at the time moved its headquarters out of the country, and while I had an offer there, it didn’t work for me personally, so I decided to leave and started looking. I had always wanted a line job rather than a strategy / business planning role, but the problem was that after several years in consulting people don’t see you for those types of positions. I had the understanding that I would have to “start over” at a new company, and was prepared to pay the toll and work my way up at my next firm. Through a friend’s referral, I got the interview at LAN Airlines for a hard core ops job dealing with processes, improving costs, and negotiating with suppliers. I didn’t think I would get the offer considering my background (I didn’t expect to skip the toll!). It turns out that my team is made up of very strong operators, and the company was looking for more of a strategic vision. I was brought in to challenge their core, and change processes when necessary.</p>\n<p>For consultants looking for a P&amp;L opportunity, you need to be clear about what you want to do. With everyone I talked to (Partners, headhunters, etc.), I had a consistent story: I told them I understood the toll I would pay, but that a line role was something I really wanted. While at Booz, I’d also like to think I went about it the right way. I got involved in a very important project, and when I knew I wanted to move, I started telling the Partners I knew and trusted and asked them for advice. They provided an absolutely amazing network, which is also something consultants should remember – it can be frustrating if you feel “burned out” on a project etc., but never jeopardize your network. It becomes your crash pad later on when you’re looking to move elsewhere.</p>\n<p><em>Having spent most of your career with a focus on CPG and retail, what prompted the move into transportation services? What are your initial thoughts on the industry?</em></p>\n<p>When I moved into my current role, I was more worried about the function and getting the right experience than the industry itself – I have had exposure to many industries through consulting other than CPG and retail, so learning a new industry isn’t all that scary.  Initially, I was actually worried that I wouldn’t find it that interesting – how hard can it be to transport cargo around, right? It’s actually incredibly complex, and each operation and country has its own set of issues (cost of labor, type of cargo, availability of suppliers, etc.). I find it extremely exciting and entertaining.</p>\n<p><em>Having grown up and spent your pre-MBA career in South America, much of your post-Booz corporate career has been focused on that geographic region.  Was it a conscious decision to double down in that area? How do you think your international experience has affected your outlook / approach as an executive today?</em></p>\n<p>Going into my first post-Booz role in the Latin America office of Wal-Mart, it helped that I spoke the language, and that I had familiarity with a hot market people wanted to talk about (Brazil). Now, my role is very much a global one, and I have P&amp;L responsibility for stations all over the world. In a global role, I think it’s important to understand how to balance both the generalities and peculiarities – each place has its own specific circumstances, but if you think of how you will address things in terms of every single location, you lose all efficiency and economies of scale. You need to have a strategy and system that can work broadly and be calibrated to each different market. Coming from Brazil, it helps to know how one of our large markets works from the inside out, making conversations with teams easier, etc.</p>\n<p><em>What are your plans for professional development and growth?  Do you see yourself in big corporate for the long-term?</em></p>\n<p>Yes, big corporate is the career I’ve chosen for myself. For the long-term, the target has always been to become a General Manager at some point – in taking my current role, I knew operations would complement my previous experience in strategy, marketing and sales, and took it as a way to round out my experience as a General Manager.</p>\n",

      "content": "<hr />\n<p>As you make the leap from <strong>consulting into corporate</strong>, reign in your horses and guide your path precisely. There is a clear divide in career decision making between current consultants and seasoned former consultants. The majority of current consultants have such pent up desire to &#8220;own something&#8221; that they look past positioning moves. Senior leaders know that each move counts, and they want to see where a role will take them. In the span of a few years, you could go from a candidate for a VP of Strategy role to a candidate for a CEO of a $2bn public company, but it all depends on how well you have built upon your skill set and where it adds the most value.</p>\n<p>Obviously, big companies are the ones that send the most money to consulting firms, so most consultants have spent time advising large corporations and are biased against joining one. Many large corporations have earned their reputations for being slow, bureaucratic, and loaded with &#8220;dead wood&#8221; in the talent pool. As a Director or VP of Strategy, the fear is that you&#8217;ll be layers away from the CEO in a stodgy organization. But a select few mammoth companies are packed with outstanding talent, offer dozens of career opportunities for you to take advantage of, and have brand names that are known around the world. These are the &#8220;great places to be from,&#8221; and they change from time to time, somewhat according to their ability to attract talent such as you.</p>\n<p>Contrast this with a startup, family-owned company, or a mom and pop shop portfolio company of a major PE firm. Most startups fail, and that stat applies to the one you’re interviewing with. Family-owned Italian restaurants are great, but family-owned companies are filled with quirky leadership, unreasonably sized egos, and about-face changes in direction. And while working for a portfolio company of a major PE firm or well-known middle market PE firm can be a great way to build wealth and your resume, smaller shops don&#8217;t offer the same level of expertise and consistency with their ability to attract and retain talent and deliver results. Plus, you don&#8217;t benefit from the brand awareness of having a big PE shop as your sponsor, so all you really have going for you is a President/SVP/VP role with a $200mn company that makes stuff from the 1950s, is bleeding money, and has product liability issues that the owners forgot to tell you about.</p>\n<p>You joined your consulting firm because of its brand name, number of practice areas, advancement opportunities, and the amount you&#8217;d learn. Three years later, have you learned all that there is to know? You&#8217;re really just beginning, so we urge you to seriously consider going to a well-known company with revered leadership and a solid track record of turning management consultants into executive leaders. You don&#8217;t have to stay there forever. The three years you spend with this &#8220;great place to be from&#8221; will open all sorts of doors for you, with a fraction of the risk.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<p class=\"profile-intro\">Position: Vice President, Talent Acquisition</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">Current Firm: Suntrust Banks, Inc.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>You spent the first eight years of your career at ConocoPhillips, and then left for Harvard Business School. Why did you pursue your MBA at that point in your career rather than earlier, or never?</em></p>\n<p>It was always a goal of mine to go to either law school or business school. I decided to pursue my MBA because I had worked for eight years and the timing felt right. I figured I had to go to one of the top schools to get the career uplift I was looking for. I ultimately chose HBS because it was very case study driven rather than textbook driven. I wanted to do case studies, not take multiple choice tests.</p>\n<p><em>After business school you joined Booz &amp; Company’s Energy Practice for three years. Did you know going into business school that you wanted to pursue consulting?</em></p>\n<p>Yes. I wasn’t necessarily looking to do the energy practice, but my experience in the energy sector made my value proposition greater.</p>\n<p><em>In 1998 you left Booz to join Korn/Ferry in Los Angeles. How did you go from helping companies plan strategy and optimize their supply chain, to helping companies hire the people who would take on those projects?</em></p>\n<p>As much as I wanted to do consulting, I realized I wasn’t getting a lot of pure satisfaction out of it. I was getting much more satisfaction out of the variety of recruiting activities I was participating in. I did recruiting at Conoco pre-MBA and also as an extracurricular activity at Booz Allen. I really enjoyed it, but recruiting isn’t the core business of consulting. If I was ever going to move up at Booz, I needed to stay on the business side and not on the HR side. But recruiting was my true passion and I decided to follow it.</p>\n<p>My MD at Booz Allen asked if I was sure it was the right move, because it was a different path than that of the typical HBS grad. I locked myself in a hotel room in NYC for three days to think through it, and spoke with a trusted friend who was very grounded. With his help, I realized that I got a lot more enjoyment out of finishing a search assignment than I did from finishing a project in consulting. I decided to stick with recruiting.</p>\n<p><em>What prompted the transition to internal talent acquisition after three years at Korn/Ferry?</em></p>\n<p>The transition into talent acquisition wasn’t completely planned. It was 2001, right after 9/11 and when the tech boom went bust. Trying to develop business during that time was very challenging. Additionally, I wanted to try talent acquisition because it was difficult to balance business development and execution in recruiting. I also tend to be somewhat of an adventurer, so I wanted to try something different. Talent acquisition allowed me to focus on execution and strategy, and I was able to develop managerial skills by leading a team.</p>\n<p><em>You’ve had the opportunity to do talent acquisition for a few different industries including media, hospitality, technology, and most recently, financial services. What factors motivated you to explore a variety of industries rather than sticking with the energy industry? Which has been your favorite industry?</em></p>\n<p>I’m driven more by the functional expertise than the industry. The entertainment industry and the hospitality industry were fun because of the nature of the business, and I really enjoyed that. But overall I’ve been pretty impartial to industry and just focused on doing recruiting, wherever it is.</p>\n<p><em>In your years of experience in talent acquisition, you’ve witnessed tons of consultants navigate the interview process and the transition to a corporate role. What are the most common mistakes you see?</em></p>\n<p>Especially if consultants are coming from the top firms, they tend to believe that they are prepared to (and entitled to) run a business. I think that’s a misunderstanding. Consultants are strategic problem-solvers, but they lack the experience of ownership. In consulting, you only have a short-lived exposure to your corporate clients. You miss out on that accountability.</p>\n<p>It can also be a challenge for consultants to transition into a corporation. When you’re in one of these top consultancies, you’re very used to dealing with a Type A, self-motivated, highly-educated workforce. In a corporation, the workforce is not as consistent.</p>\n<p><em>What specific experiences or skills make a consultant’s resume stand out from those of his peers?</em></p>\n<p>There are three major factors that make a consultant’s resume stand out: (1) experience with a major corporation prior to consulting; (2) experience consulting not only in Fortune 500 companies but also in smaller, high-growth companies; and (3) entrepreneurial experience.</p>\n<p><em>You have worked in a variety of companies. Does every consultant work well in every company culture?</em></p>\n<p>Different consultants match up to different companies. My last company, Asurion, was private equity-owned. We grew 350% in a very short period of time. There were not a lot of processes, procedures, or protocols in place – you had to figure it out. I call Asurion an “essay” or “case study” type of company, rather than a “fill in the blank” or “multiple choice” type of company. For a consultant to be successful at Asurion, he or she needed to be able to go in and figure things out in a creative way. On the other hand, you wouldn’t put a creative problem solver who wants to enact change into a more structured corporation. The lack of flexibility and learning agility would be frustrating to them.</p>\n<p>You can say “Consultants at the big firms are very smart and have a great pedigree” – that’s great, but they also have a lot of methodologies that they apply, and can be highly structured compared to someone at a smaller firm who has to figure out a lot more on his own. I think that those consultants that come from smaller consultancies sometimes have an advantage. A combination of experience in smaller and larger consultancies is probably the best of both worlds.</p>\n<p><em>If a consultant has a great resume, they obviously move on to the interview phase. What are the most common mistakes consultants make in an interview? On the flip side, what makes one interview better than the rest?</em></p>\n<p>Arrogance is something to be avoided. It is also important not to be too theoretical – consultants don’t always give concrete examples, and they often talk in theory instead of offering examples of results. A consultant is impressive if he can show that he is very capable of thinking on his feet, has good communication skills, and is confident without being arrogant.</p>\n<p><em>You’ve lived in a variety of cities including Los Angeles, Houston, Las Vegas, Nashville, and now Atlanta. Were you always geographically open-minded when considering new opportunities?</em></p>\n<p>Most of the time, I was geographically open-minded. There were places I didn’t want to go but I thought “why not, I’ll try it!” I did not want to move to Las Vegas, and I definitely didn’t want to move to Nashville. I wasn’t initially keen on moving to Atlanta. But I ultimately said “yes” to each of these cities, welcoming the opportunity to learn by living in different areas. I’ve lived on the East Coast, the West Coast, the Gulf Coast, the Rockies, the Southeast, and in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, and I’m very happy that I’ve done so.</p>\n<p><em>What should consultants keep in mind when considering relocation?</em></p>\n<p>I would encourage consultants to give the U.S. a chance beyond the East and West Coast. A lot of people seem to believe nothing exists in between – but there’s Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Denver… it’s a lot cheaper to live in some of these locations, and sometimes you can be a bigger fish in a smaller sea.</p>\n<p><em>What have you taken from your experience in consulting that has helped guide you to where you are today?</em></p>\n<p>From consulting and from business school, I carry with me a whole problem-solving skill set. Whatever the problem is, I can build a case to determine how to attack it. I’m now a “case study” person rather than a “multiple choice” type of person.</p>\n<p><em>Where will you be in five years?</em></p>\n<p>It’s hard to say where I will be in five years. I would love to be running talent acquisition on the international front. It depends what opportunities arise – as you can see, I take them.</p>\n",

      "short_URL": "http://wp.me/p7C5yw-62",
      "content": "<hr />\n<p>Startups are exciting &#8211; you can learn a lot and you&#8217;ll probably get hands-on experience. But the unfortunate matter is that there&#8217;s only a fraction of a percentage chance that you&#8217;ll actually earn some good money with one, or position yourself optimally for the rest of your career. So why does a group of people known for being risk-averse see so many of its kind fall off the radar early in their careers to the riskiest of all career choices? Because you&#8217;re people, and you still make emotional decisions and you&#8217;re still looking for instant gratification &#8211; an instant senior level role and responsibilities&#8230;and instant millions.</p>\n<p>But there have always been and always will be startups, so don&#8217;t pressure yourself into believing that the call you just received is that &#8220;opportunity of a lifetime.&#8221; We are not suggesting that startups should be avoided (if you get a great offer with the hottest show in town, take it!), but we will suggest that you think long and hard before joining 98% of them, especially if it is your first move out of consulting and will be the anchor of your post-MBA &#8220;corporate&#8221; career. The <strong>key issue with startups</strong> is that most of the time, you will work for a company that has very small revenue and scale, few resources, no brand awareness, and a small likelihood of real success. Even if the startup does succeed, what does that translate to for you? You might be able to add a ton of value to the startup; you might put some real numbers on the board, and you might help it become a decent small company with a path to being midsize over the next 5 years. But if the equity doesn&#8217;t hit a home run in that time period, then you have basically added a lot of value to the company without receiving a lot of value from it. And your resume now shows that you spent the past few years working for a company that nobody has ever heard of, developing your skills but not necessarily in a best-in-class environment. Anyone looking for a glutton for punishment will surely find you appealing, but the executive recruiters and boards of directors who are looking for the best talent for the key leadership jobs probably don&#8217;t know you exist, because you fell off of the radar.</p>\n<p>One of the main things that consultants cite when describing <strong>the appeal of a startup</strong> is that they will have direct reports: &#8220;This will differentiate me. For a lot of the positions I interviewed for with bigger companies, they asked about my management experience.&#8221; We would emphasize that it is more important whom you are learning from than how many people you are managing in your first role post-consulting. If the startup offers you a chance to manage a team, how great a team will it be, and what will you be able to afford? Another part of the appeal of startups is usually the combo deal of a big title (small company, so you get a big title) and a broad role (like heading up Operations, Sales, Business Development, etc.). Think of your transition into a small company with few resources, an o.k. team, and responsibilities you&#8217;ve never held before. Recipe for success?</p>\n<p>With the recent deal-of-a-lifetime sale of Instagram to Facebook, it can be especially tempting to jump at a startup opportunity. Evaluate startups carefully, because similar opportunities will likely always exist. And if you&#8217;re just leaving consulting, a flop of a startup is not the first mark you want to make on the resume you&#8217;ve worked so hard to craft.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Position: Director, Business Transformation</p>\n<p>Current Firm: Jaguar Land Rover</p>\n<p>*At the time of this interview Arthur held the role of Group Strategy and Business Development Director at Inchcape plc.</p>\n<p><em>After spending more than 10 years at BCG, you left the firm as a Partner to go into industry as a Strategy Director at Toyota Motor Europe. Why did you decide to leave BCG when you did, and what was your thought process in choosing that particular role?</em></p>\n<p>For me, after a couple of years at the Partner level, I had reached a plateau where consulting wasn’t getting more interesting. I had never been interested in internal management at that level (managing other Partners), and the firm had become much more business-oriented in that Partners were more focused on few long term clients – which necessarily leads to less variety. I wanted change and a role where I could grow beyond what I was doing at the time, which presented itself in an opportunity with a leader in the automotive industry. I liked the people and the company, and decided to make the move – without having done a job search.</p>\n<p><em>Many consultants feel they cannot get sufficient management experience before moving into industry. With senior roles at BCG including co-founder of its global automotive practice, can you expand upon your experience and how it influenced your management experience in corporate (if at all)?</em></p>\n<p>Everyone at BCG had to cover an internal management role of some sort, so it was a standard part of career development to gain management experience there. I was very active in the development of younger consultants, and I further involved myself with the recruiting process and the business school sponsorship program. Consulting is very different from corporate career development, however, because it is always temporary and “in and out” the door from both an internal and external management perspective. Internally, consulting is an inherently eager, young business, where consultants really manage themselves for the most part. With clients, you might work with them for the long-term – but you are never truly &#8220;inside&#8221;: you present your recommendation, and then company management closes its doors for an internal discussion to decide what to actually do next, plus you usually get called upon for a dedicated project, not all aspects of the business. So you hardly ever get the full exposure to all of the functions, the external stakeholders, and competitors, and it remains kind of difficult to understand them in the “real world” instead of as dots on a slide. Managing a business is different from advising one, so when speaking strictly of management, I didn’t transfer much from one to the other.</p>\n<p><em>Most of your roles in corporate have been in strategy, including your current position as Group Strategy and Business Development Director at Inchcape, after a three-year stint as a regional Managing Director at Toyota. Why the move back into strategy, and did you think you would ultimately stay in internal strategy at the outset of your corporate career? How do you compare / contrast your experience in external versus internal strategy?</em></p>\n<p>I had no definite plans in the beginning of my corporate career – I had joined a great company, and knew I would work hard from there. I took the operational role because it filled an important experience gap for me, and it was fun in that it was a very interesting, complex turnaround situation. As the day-to-day started to level out, however, I began to crave more variety (I do have the heart of a consultant, after all). For me, I found the operations role to be a little too monotonous in the long term – you launch a product, deal with the problems, launch a product, deal with other problems, and so on. In comparison, I’m very happy in my role today, which is global and comes with a broad portfolio of responsibilities.</p>\n<p>The difference between my current role and consulting is that I now see the full depth of problems I need to solve and have all of the data. In consulting, clients will share some points of what is happening, but you do not understand the full picture as you do when you are in the actual company itself. In internal management, I stay on through the analysis and into the implementation, and don’t need to worry about selling my work because I already have a seat at the executive committee table. Being part of the top management team is also very different because I have a much deeper relationship with the issues &#8211; I am partly involved in ops and in planning and development, but I am also a shareholder (even if it is a very small stake), i.e. I’m part of the problem and will remain part of the solution even when the actual project ends.</p>\n<p>I’ll mention one downside to corporate management versus consulting – I do sometimes miss having more than one work place. In consulting, you work at the client, and then &#8220;retreat&#8221; home come Friday.</p>\n<p><em>Having been involved with automotive throughout the entirety of your career, what do you find most exciting about the industry? What advice would you give consultants who are looking to go into the space?</em></p>\n<p>It’s everything I want in an industry. It combines global, consumer brands with very complex supply chains, high technology, and lots of regulatory impact as well. It’s not just complex technology that you can only really sell B2B, or simply a complex product for consumers – you have it all, it touches a lot of people, and the buyers really like the product versus something they simply need in their lives.</p>\n<p>For consultants looking to get into automotive, I would tell them to make sure they are targeting the premium / winning players. It’s not an easy industry, especially with the recent crises, bankruptcies, etc., and if you’re at a losing player it is very difficult to change the momentum of a big ship. Compared to the early 90s when car makers really only hired engineers or business grads out of school, the good news is that now all are hiring consultants regularly – and at fairly senior levels as well. R&amp;D will probably remain difficult to get into (it is the domain of engineers), but for the most part we&#8217;ve crossed the line and the doors are open. I see a lot of BCG alumni at the major players now.</p>\n<p><em>Having worked for an outside strategy firm and an automotive manufacturer, and now at an automotive retailer and distributor, what similarities or differences can you point to in each of your experiences? What prompted your switch from manufacturer to distributor?</em></p>\n<p>It’s all the same industry, really – I’ve just always liked anything to do with automotive. Working with and finally at a carmaker I mostly focused on the customer end of things – so it was only natural that I now ended up in a distribution and retail company. Inchcape is a sizable business with over 10,000 people worldwide, but compared to the large carmakers we are a small very agile company – and that is certainly a different feeling.</p>\n<p><em>You have had a lot of international experience throughout your career, and grew up / attended school in Europe. What importance do you give international experience when evaluating an executive?</em></p>\n<p>My current company is active in 26 countries on five continents, and I really enjoy that. As part of my development role I visit even more markets and always learn something new on a trip. If you’re in a senior position within a company that has an international business, it’s really hard to understand other cultures without experience making the adjustment to a different place and way of doing things. Visiting a country is very different than actually living and working there, so personal experience with that type of change and immersion is certainly valuable.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p class=\"wrap content clear\">Position: Group Managing Director</p>\n<p>Current Firm: SC Johnson</p>\n<div class=\"wrap content clear\"><em>Focusing on the beginning of your career, you stayed in consulting for two years before moving onto an MBA, followed by a role within Procter &amp; Gamble in Geneva. Can you describe your thought process and experience during that transition? Any advice you would give members who are considering a similarly timed move out of consulting?</em></div>\n<div class=\"wrap content clear\">\n<div class=\"right full\">\n<p>For my time spent in consulting, at the end I felt a bit burned out and disillusioned. I was not sure what I wanted to do yet, but knew it wasn’t in consulting. I then went to get my MBA at INSEAD, which was 5% retainable knowledge and really a year or so of exploring 240+ careers. I narrowed down my target from there – a glass of wine definitely helped.</p>\n<p><em>You have had a great deal of international exposure in both your educational and professional experiences. How do you think this has had an impact, if any, on your career?</em></p>\n<p>International exposure has had a huge impact on my career, and a good chunk of my experience has been outside of the U.S. I think that in order to work well internationally, you need to be both curious and humble, and assignments abroad are somewhat of a torture test for those two traits. You gain flexibility and an appreciation for diversity within a team, as most teams abroad have a broader spectrum of views, languages, etc., than U.S. teams have to offer.</p>\n<p>In my own experience, I worked abroad in the earlier portion of my career, and I returned to the U.S. at a time when the domestic world was starting to develop the more matrixed and vague roles you see today. There was a need for people to influence organizations. My international roles were key in my ability to have that influence, because I had been working with people in Europe in these types of global roles that the U.S. was just developing. It was as though I had gotten to pilot test it.</p>\n<p><em>You held considerable P&amp;L responsibility just four years after leaving consulting, and have had many large, operational roles since then. As many consultants aim for P&amp;L experience as they move to corporate, how would you suggest they best prepare themselves for a chance at one of these roles?</em></p>\n<p>It’s hard to prepare for an operational role while you’re still in consulting. In corporate, you have an easier time, but usually consultants will come into planning roles where they’re still in a box and it’s hard to project into that P&amp;L position. Once you have moved into corporate, your best option is to find a sponsor with a consulting background who can pull you through to those roles despite your lack of experience. In consulting, there’s not enough rigor around your realities, and you need to have the intellectual ability to dial in and make the impact.</p>\n<p><em>You have held key marketing and management roles at several multi-billion dollar corporations, including Kimberly-Clark, Coca Cola, and P&amp;G, throughout your career. What aspect of marketing do you like best? What aspect of leading and managing a team?</em></p>\n<p>Lots of people like the creative side of marketing, but it has never really been the thing that fires me up. I like marketing because I’m intellectually curious, and always want to dig deep and find the root cause of things – why things work for the consumer. It’s also great for someone who is competitive because it’s pretty clear when the consumer votes who wins and who loses. I’ve really enjoyed the strong collaboration required in marketing as well – in consulting, you have teams and strategize, but you don’t talk about moving into execution where it takes a lot of different roles to make the final product.</p>\n<p>For management, it’s different in corporate compared to consulting. In consulting there are lots of great training programs, but with the high turnover and consultants constantly switching from project to project, you’re not so much working on the development of your specific team and its capabilities. In a corporate setting, you have a real interest in building your team from within, complemented with recruiting from outside. As a manager you have to understand that you can’t simply send your team to a training program – you have to help them by mentoring, coaching, etc.</p>\n<p><em>As a major influencer and leader in a multi-billion dollar CPG company today, what are your next goals for self development and professional growth?</em></p>\n<p>At the highest level, I want to leave a legacy, a mark on the business after I’m gone. Looking now, I have a lot to do with our business trajectory, and I can see my influence in that. On another level I’d like to make my mark with the people I bring on, and want to fill a shallow bench with ready-now candidates. Beyond talent, I want to work on process and structure&#8230;there’s always room to improve.</p>\n<p><em>Which of the skills that you gained in consulting has added the most value to your life outside of work?</em></p>\n<p>My consulting experience was long ago, but I still appreciate the sense of self-awareness I developed from it. You know how to go into a room, read the situation, adapt to it, and make a difference. Another part which may sound more cynical, and it’s not meant to be, is knowing how to fake it. You may not know what you’re talking about the entire time, but you know how to frame things and get by so you can then go back and get the facts. Taking that idea very much outside of work – when your children ask you things that you don’t know, it helps!</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

      "content": "<div class=\"profile-intro\">\n<p>Position: VP, Head of Global Strategic Pricing</p>\n<p>Current Firm: Estee Lauder Companies</p>\n<p>*At the time of this interview Lanchi held the role of Executive Director of North American Strategy at Avon Products, Inc.</p>\n<p><em>After five years at ATK, you left as a Manager to join American Express’ Strategy Group. Why did you decide to leave ATK when you did, and what is your advice for consultants who are considering a move? Did you ever consider the Partner path?</em></p>\n<p>I considered the Partner path from the beginning of my consulting career, and had not planned on leaving before achieving that level. If you are to leave consulting, there are two natural points to leave: the two-year mark, after you have been through the first promotion cycle, and the five-year mark, at which point you have to make the commitment to push for Partner. At my five-year mark, I had my second child, which was a personal game changer for me, and I had to weigh the pros and cons of choosing to pursue Partner with my new family dynamic.</p>\n<p>As you become more senior in consulting, you expand your network and gain additional control over some aspects of the job. An area where you do not have that control, however, is travel, because you have to follow the plum assignments that will best set you up for the next level. This meant I would be on the road more and not less, which would exacerbate the strains in my family life. So the choice was to either “see what happens” with my family or leave consulting. I chose to leave consulting for an opportunity in industry that would require less travel, and it worked. I chose a company that knew how leverage former consultants looking for work life balance. Working in this environment, where 60% of the team were ex-consultants like me, gave me a soft landing as we all &#8220;spoke the same language&#8221;. My new role also took me off the road completely, allowing me to spend quality time with my family.</p>\n<p>As you become more senior in consulting, you expand your network and gain additional control over some aspects of the job. An area where you do not have that control, however, is travel, because you have to follow the plum assignments that will best set you up for the next level. This meant I would be on the road more and not less, which would exacerbate the strains in my family life.  So the choice was to either “see what happens” with my family or leave consulting.  I chose to leave consulting for an opportunity in industry that would require less travel, and it worked.  I chose a company that knew how leverage former consultants looking for work life balance. Working in this environment, where 60% of the team were ex-consultants like me, gave me a soft landing as we all &#8220;spoke the same language&#8221;.  My new role also took me off the road completely, allowing me to spend quality time with my family.</p>\n<p><em>Having been in the General Practice at A.T. Kearney as well as internal strategy across different industries including financial services and consumer goods, are you tied to any specific industry at this point?  Why or why not?</em></p>\n<p>Personally, I love CPG.  Most of my consulting projects were in that area, including work on the consumer side of marketing. Even my work in financial services involved working with a consumer-facing product. I like the idea of working with a tangible product that plays a role in people’s lives.  As a learning opportunity, it offers insight into a variety of topics, from consumer segmentation, demographic, cultural influencers to the role a “brand” plays in influencing purchasing and usage behavior.  It is as much about the product as it is about the people that the products touch.</p>\n<p>In addition to my work in CPG, I have also gained expertise from 10-12 years of experience working across other industries.  This has allowed me to identify and appreciate commonalities in challenges and opportunities that exist for companies regardless of their industries. This is why I feel comfortable “crossing industry lines”.</p>\n<p><em>From your own experience and knowledge as Head of North American Strategy at Avon, what separates a great Head of Strategy position from a good Head of Strategy position?</em></p>\n</div>\n<p>If a company is good at acquiring and managing talent, you will find a lot of smart people on strategy teams. However, being smart just gets you into the game. To be effective, I think you need three basic elements. The first is your relationship with the head of the business or company &#8211; specifically, how open and honest you can be with the person. There is no absolute right answer in strategy, and too often you can get paralyzed by analysis. The “right” answer comes from identifying the best fit, most relevant and &#8220;execution-able&#8221; path for your company. Having access to the business unit lead, and the ability to speak openly and honestly with this person, is an enabler in identifying the &#8220;right&#8221; strategy for the company &#8211; the one that has his / her support, because a strategy isn&#8217;t good if it can’t be implemented.</p>\n<p>The second element is your ability to recognize, attract and develop a strong team. This is essential to any successful leader – but particularly to strategy, as your asset really is the team and not the individual.</p>\n<p>The last element is conviction and passion for the job. Strategy is not about growth all the time, and if a company is in dire straits the strategy lead will need to help identify how to change company direction. Not everyone thrives in change, or welcomes change, so you will find yourself proposing some tough choices. You have to be able to lead throughout all of this – and I think you need conviction and passion to help you through.</p>\n<p><em>You went from working at smaller companies abroad to staying in relatively the same location with much larger, multi-billion dollar global firms here in the U.S.  How do you compare / contrast the different experiences?  Do you think one or the other is more valuable for corporate success today? </em></p>\n<p>I worked in smaller companies in the beginning of my career, which allowed me to handle a lot more responsibility at a much younger age (it was also a lot easier to take risks and make mistakes back then!). Getting an MBA helped validate and enhance my early experiences, enabling me to join much larger companies. Both phases of my career, before and after graduate school, helped round out my exposure to different types and size companies.</p>\n<p>From my personal experience, I think it is good to have worked in both environments because having the range allows you to appreciate the pros and cons of each. If a company is too big, it can be slow to move, make decisions or affect change. But if a company is too small, it might lack resourcing which could inhibit growth.</p>\n<p>If I have to choose, I prefer the mid-sized companies, because it allows me to see impact more quickly. In a larger company, it can take a lot longer to make things happen or see your plans take affect. It is not necessarily a bad thing, but would take longer to learn where you need to course correct.</p>\n<p><em>You co-founded a startup just before A.T. Kearney and have since worked at two Fortune 200 companies.  Do you think you would go about a startup any differently now with your additional consulting / corporate experiences? </em></p>\n<p>Our startup took advantage of the market at a time when there were very few services available that provided company information, specifically in Asia. We created a company based on that demand, and eventually sold it to a firm with the resources to carry it further. Looking back, it would have been helpful to have been more familiar with the startup lifecycle, and to know that there is a real window of opportunity to raise enough money before you start operations. In terms of what I would have done differently, I think I would have been much more aggressive to keep control of the firm, and to continue to do that sort of entrepreneurial work. But it was during the time I was emerging from business school so I felt like I had to grow up and take the offer from a management consulting firm.</p>\n<p><em>What has it been like working with other former consultants at your two most recent companies (American Express and Avon)?  Do you have any tips for current consultants about how to best thrive in a large company corporate environment?</em></p>\n<p>You cannot underestimate the value of building a network as soon as you land in corporate. Consulting firms are built to create those networks to facilitate team work and group success. In industry you have to make your own way because it is not always part of the corporate structure. Also, you do need to adjust your expectations on the pace at which things can move or get done. Projects have longer lead times and decisions involve more people than in consulting.</p>\n<p><em>What would you say is the most important skill that got you where you are today? What skills or perspective did you take specifically from consulting that makes you successful in your job now?</em></p>\n<p>The five years that I spent in consulting taught me how to listen, ask questions, structure my thinking and work with ambiguity. Those are functional skills that I have used in every job since. No question is too small, too stupid or too obvious to ask. You can’t be afraid to ask questions – which help give you valuable information. This is key to helping you learn quickly.</p>\n<p>What I learned from my industry jobs has helped me adjust to different work styles, levels of motivation and definition of success. Consultants tend to be alike on these three dimensions – because we were hired to “fit” with each other. My colleagues in industry tend to offer more variety and diversity in background and ways of thinking.</p>\n",

      "content": "<div class=\"profile-intro\">\n<p>Position: Chief Information Security Officer</p>\n<p>Current Firm: Intuit</p>\n<p>*At the time of this interview Indu was Chief Technology Officer of Sungard Availability Services.</p>\n<p><em>Consultants often complain of a lack of ownership, and you went from your role at McKinsey to co-founding and establishing a product in your next role at BEA Systems, a multi-billion dollar technology company. Can you describe your experience throughout that transition? What advice would you give those who have an entrepreneurial itch, considering your experience doing that type of work within a larger company versus a startup?</em></p>\n<p>There were two big changes in the transition: 1) in top-tier consulting, you almost never have to motivate people because everyone is a self-starter and self-driven, and 2) getting work done in the “real” world involves working through people who may have different motivations or drive in comparison to your own. At McKinsey, I rarely had to follow up on any action more than once, and that’s not quite as true in the real world. On the other hand, people in the real world are always juggling a number of priorities, and for them to pay attention to what you need necessitates a re-juggling – it requires you to practice your influencing skills to the utmost.</p>\n<p>With regard to a startup versus a large company, it ultimately comes down to your ability to tolerate risk, and the kinds of actions for which you want to hold yourself responsible. It’s possible to be entrepreneurial even within a large company – you have a better support system, and don’t have to worry about payroll, for example. Conversely, the rewards are more limited, and you have to play by rules set within the larger organization which can be frustrating at times.</p>\n<p><em>You were on a fast track at McKinsey but left after three years at the firm. Did you ever consider the Partner path?</em></p>\n<p>Not really – I’m more of a doer. I was trained as an engineer, so McKinsey was by far the best way for me to learn about business, but I’d never considered myself a career consultant.</p>\n<p><em>How has consulting helped, or in any way hurt, your career?</em></p>\n<p>On balance, it’s been a positive for my career. In consulting, you gain clear communication, the ability to synthesize vast amounts of information, comfort communicating with the C-level, and wide exposure to various types of businesses and issues – all which can translate well in the corporate world.</p>\n<p>There are certainly some pitfalls to avoid when making the switch, however. For a consultant who aspires to get into an operational role, the biggest risk is analysis paralysis. As a consultant, you aim to be data-driven and analytical, whereas in business situations you frequently have to make a judgment call with the best data you have, even if it’s nowhere near being enough. The other big risk as a consultant looking to transition to an operational role is that as a consultant, you’re often paid to be the smartest person in the room. As an executive, that’s often the kiss of death – you could miss out on the best constructive advice because you have created an environment where your teams cannot disagree with you. You also have to pay a lot more attention to understanding what motivates people and how you achieve results.</p>\n<p><em>Being the CTO of the largest division SunGard Availability Services must be a pretty exciting role. Is it what you expected? What do you like best, and least, about your role today?</em></p>\n<p>I’d never been a CTO before, and the only CTOs I knew were really good speakers, so my greatest fear was that I would just turn out to be a talking head and not be sufficiently operational. I’m glad to say that hasn’t been the case at all!</p>\n<p>What I love about my role is I get to define the future – what trends to care about, what products to bring to market, how can we differentiate against the competition, and where can we take the business in 3-5 years. It’s especially thrilling when you launch new services and products that take off faster than anything the company has seen in over a decade. That’s just rewarding!</p>\n<p>What’s been enormously difficult in my role has been bringing about the necessary culture change at SunGard, because we hadn’t innovated for a very long time prior to 2009 (when I got here). Within my first six months, it became clear that a number of the teams were not a good fit for where we needed to take the company, so we had to make the tough decision to let many of them go. Even though it was the right business decision, I just didn’t like it &#8211; and still don’t.</p>\n<p><em>What would you say is the most important skill that got you where you are today? What did you take specifically from consulting that makes you successful in your current role?</em></p>\n<p>I think I’ve been very lucky. For specific skills that have helped me get where I am today, I think one is tactical composure. I perform best when my back is to the wall, stay calm in stressful situations and can lead my teams through them. The ability to assimilate information and change my view / opinion has also been a factor – as a consultant, you are hypothesis-driven, but when you make business decisions with little to go off of, you have to be able to confirm or dismiss your theory and change your course of direction if needed. A third skill is being able to distill problems into essentials, without getting too distracted by other unnecessary elements surrounding it. This was enhanced by the classic 80/20 training at McKinsey, but was something that came naturally and is inherent in how I assess situations.</p>\n<p>From consulting specifically, I think learning to acknowledge my mistakes, and surrounding myself with exceptional people who can complement my skills, have both been essential to my success. One of the principles I learned at McKinsey was the “obligation to dissent” – you should always speak up if you disagree with a conclusion and engage in the debate. Going along with an answer when you don’t believe in it is absolutely the wrong thing to do.</p>\n<p><em>Having held major leadership positions in product development and management at multi-billion dollar technology firms, and in a CTO role at a multi-billion dollar division within a PE portfolio company today, what’s your next target in terms of personal progression and development?</em></p>\n<p>I’m still having a very good time, but at some point in the future I’d like to run my own show, preferably in a CEO role. I want to start something and build a company that can last – not a 20 person firm that grows to a $100mn, but bigger than that. I want to grow a company that can survive me.</p>\n<p><em>As a CTO, part of your job is to know the market and define a vision for your company. What is the most exciting part of the tech scene for you today? What would you recommend for consultants looking to get into the technology space?</em></p>\n<p>This is a really exciting time in technology – it feels like the pace of innovation has never been greater. Cloud is clearly transformational and Big Data is going to change how business decisions are made for years to come.</p>\n<p>The biggest challenge consultants run into in technology is being perceived as excessively glib and smooth-talking. As any Dilbert reader knows, engineers have little patience for the MBA who comes in and is excessively smooth, utters all the latest buzzwords, but hasn’t got a clue about technical feasibility of any of the concepts. Being able to listen and understand the customer pain is one of the biggest values consultants can bring to any startup venture.</p>\n<p><em>You stayed in relatively the same area throughout the majority of your career. Did you ever consider any international moves that would bring you back abroad? How did growing up outside of the U.S. have an impact, if any, on your approach to your career and experience?</em></p>\n<p>I haven’t considered any international moves seriously, although I’m looking forward to spending time in Europe and / or Asia over the next 10 years in my career.</p>\n<p>As for growing up in India, there was a tremendous focus on math and science at a very young age, so I had a focus on those from the start. I also grew up in an environment where there was an appreciation for things that matter more than money. You really need to enjoy what you do and have a passion for it – it’s not just about how well it pays, and if you’re not passionate about something then it is not worth doing.</p>\n<p><em>Which of the skills that you gained in consulting has added the most value to your life outside of work?</em></p>\n<p>I’d have to say time management here – as a consultant, you really have to learn how to juggle a million priorities. As a good mentor used to say, &#8220;the client comes first and family is the first client.&#8221; A bit of a cliché, but you understand the concept! Having clear “work time” versus “family time” has been essential to maintaining some sort of a balance between work and life for me.</p>\n</div>\n",

      "content": "<hr />\n<p>For years companies have relied on external consulting firms to solve their internal problems. While external consultants are experienced and efficient, they sometimes require a long time to understand the nuances of a client and evaluate a situation before they can effectively begin the problem-solving process. Once they arrive at a recommendation, they typically produce a nicely-bound report full of graphs, charts and figures, but often with vague implementation guidelines. Certainly external consultants are valuable when a company needs an outside perspective or specialized expertise on a particular project, but in general, companies could benefit greatly from a faster, cheaper, permanent solution to handle internal strategic challenges. What is the solution? An internal consulting group.</p>\n<p>Creating an internal consulting group may sound like an expensive proposition, but in the long term its benefits can far outweigh its initial cost. Internal consultants can respond easily to new problems as they arise or spot them before they become significant. They have more knowledge of the company than any external group and therefore take less time to understand the details and challenges surrounding a particular problem. They are also familiar with the politics of an organization and other internal nuances that outsiders would be completely unaware of when trying to develop a resolution. And unlike external consultants, internal consultants are personally accountable for their work. Their job does not end with a final presentation. They are involved in the monitoring and implementation of their recommendations.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most compelling aspect of an internal consulting group, however, is its ability to funnel talent into a company. Talented individuals desire flexibility and the opportunity to rise within an organization. Usually if an individual wants to move up the executive ladder, they must subject themselves to being pigeonholed and locked into a singular track when joining a corporation. If that same person desires flexibility and constant change in a job, they often will pursue consulting. There is really no position that combines both the flexibility of consulting and the opportunity for advancement in the corporate hierarchy. Talented individuals will be attracted to a company that offers the opportunity to gain broad business experience in a flexible role, while being groomed for an executive position. This is exactly the opportunity that internal consulting provides. Internal consultants obtain a thorough understanding of the entire organization through their continual problem-solving assignments, making their work the ideal training and proving ground for future executives within a company. Internal consultants also enjoy the intellectual challenge comparable to that of a consulting firm, with the added benefit of no extensive travel or other sacrifices common to a consulting lifestyle.</p>\n<p>Companies that are looking to create their own internal consulting groups should understand that to build one successfully requires a significant initial investment. It is necessary to hire an experienced consultant in order to establish the framework for the internal group as well as provide training and structure for subsequent hires. There will need to be a concerted, well-funded recruiting effort to attract talented individuals from the top management consulting firms. And though these costs are high, they are one time, sunk costs. Once the consulting group is well established, it becomes far more economical than using external consulting firms, and its strong reputation will make attracting top-tier talent easier. From a long-term perspective, the internal consulting group’s lack of need to generate a profit on individual projects, and faster response time due to familiarity with the company, will result in overall lower costs than if the company hired external consulting firms to handle the same work.</p>\n<p>By forming an internal consulting group, a company not only achieves lower costs, faster development of strategic solutions, and an influx of talent – it also acquires a better understanding of itself. The knowledge accumulated by the internal consultants during their projects provides greater insight into the company’s processes, resources, potentials, and limitations. The consultants bring this knowledge into the daily workings of the company as they work with other employees in implementing solutions or when they rotate into line management positions. This type of intellectual capital can only be gained through internal consulting. External consultants rarely become involved enough with one company to develop this detailed level of understanding and share it with others in the organization.</p>\n<p>Companies should by no means put a complete end to hiring external consultants. They are still necessary for projects that require expertise which internal consultants lack or when a neutral, outside perspective is necessary. However, companies should lessen their dependence on outside expertise and begin to realize the benefits of internal consulting. There is no better way for a company to improve itself than by learning to solve its own problems.</p>\n<p><strong>For more</strong>:</p>\n<p>Strategy Track |  our overview of the strategy function, and how a move into internal strategy can benefit a consultant’s career.</p>\n<p>Consulting to Internal Strategy: What to Expect | know these not-so-small differences between consulting and internal strategy roles in order to hit the ground running.</p>\n<p>Management Tip: Don’t Leave This Skill Behind | how management through influence can be harder to hone than direct management, and its importance when building your career and overall impact on an organization.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<hr />\n<h5 style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>By Bruce Raines | April 2012</strong></h5>\n<p><strong>&#8220;The Program&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>You&#8217;ve done the easy part! You went through &#8220;The Program.&#8221; This is the part of your life from college to now that is universally accepted as the way to build your business career &#8211; up to and including, management consulting. It goes something like this:</p>\n<p>You completed your degree from a top undergraduate school, worked for two to four years in a &#8220;positioning job&#8221; for grad school, then ground through that MBA or equivalent at another top institution. Then you gave up a &#8220;real life&#8221; for several years of management consulting, traveling to &#8220;East Wherever&#8221; and solving other people&#8217;s problems.</p>\n<p>But now you&#8217;ve had enough; you&#8217;ve paid your dues. You&#8217;re not only ready for a lifestyle change, but it&#8217;s time to do something in the real world. You want something challenging, but also that&#8217;s &#8220;fun.&#8221; Of course, it has to keep you &#8220;in the money&#8221; and have an incredible upside. And by the way, this CEO thing: it has to happen in five years.</p>\n<p>And why shouldn&#8217;t it happen? You&#8217;re a highly trained business consultant who has gone to the best schools and advised senior management at some of the most prestigious companies in the world. Everyone should want to hire you. That&#8217;s why you spent 10-15 years of your life killing yourself: to get to CEO. After all, isn&#8217;t it guaranteed?</p>\n<p>Not quite guaranteed! The real answer is &#8220;maybe yes; maybe no.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Your future CEO status depends in great part on your first professional move out of management consulting. This is truly the fork in the road of your career, and your decision at this time is critical to your ultimate success.</p>\n<p>Management consultants are among the most broadly trained professionals in business. But your diverse set of skills could leave you with too many options. Do you go corporate, pre-IPO, VC or private equity? Product or service? Established industry or new economy company? Strategy or operations? Staff or line? What about your title? How important is it? And how many people do you have to manage to be a “player”?</p>\n<p>So many options! How do you make the right decision? Hopefully, the following will provide a roadmap, especially if you are thinking &#8220;CEO.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Building Blocks</strong></p>\n<p>Your path to CEO is constructed upon a solid foundation of building blocks. These building blocks in your career started way back in grade school and successfully positioned you for the top college, B-school and work environments, including management consulting, which rapidly moved your career forward. Because you&#8217;re not going to be a CEO now (except in entrepreneurial or exceptional circumstances), you must continue to create solid career building blocks to escalate your professional status until ultimately reaching CEO. This is your No. 1 strategy to CEO.</p>\n<p>The choice you make now will impact and determine the rest of your career, so it&#8217;s crucial you make a good one. In the vast majority of cases, your first job / employer out of consulting will not be the final stop in your career. So it&#8217;s critically important that this stop becomes a successful building block for the next job and / or corporation. By following this logic throughout your post-management consulting career, you continue to control your own destiny to CEO.</p>\n<p><strong>The Fork in the Road to CEO</strong></p>\n<p>If you want to be a CEO of a mid-sized to a large company, know that the majority of chief executives’ backgrounds have common links. Almost all of these CEOs come from one of two worlds: they either trained in a big corporate organization, or they started the company. Period.</p>\n<p><strong>The Major Corporate Route</strong></p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve got your sights set on CEO, the question becomes, Where to start? Because most corporate managers of mid-sized to large companies trained in bigger, corporate environments, the best place to begin is often with a large company. Choose one that&#8217;s either product or service-based, but make sure it&#8217;s big. The large corporate world can give you a number of advantages that other companies can&#8217;t:</p>\n<p><em>Scale</em>&#8211; Major corporations operate on a large and often international scale. Their systems and procedures that encompass the process are usually state-of-the-art, and you get paid for learning how to use and run them. In most large companies, the geographic scale also includes both domestic and international business, a major plus in broadening your background.</p>\n<p><em>Training and Mentoring</em>&#8211; As much as you learned about big companies in college, business school, and management consulting, it was nothing compared to what you&#8217;ll learn on the inside of a major corporation. As a consultant, you simply advised senior management, and your reputation left when you did. Here, there&#8217;s continuity. You&#8217;ll have a chance to work with and learn from the top personnel in the company and ultimately implement a real-world strategy.</p>\n<p><em>Promotions and Raises</em>&#8211; Big company, big opportunity. It&#8217;s that simple. Large companies have more levels on the corporate ladder, which translates into broader, large-scale responsibility with each promotion.</p>\n<p><em>Less Risk, More Security</em>&#8211; The pre-IPO is sexier but often riskier. The corporate world is more stable and offers many more opportunities for generic skill acquisition, scale, and training, plus visibility to the executives in your industry. There are naysayers who complain of too much bureaucracy, but those who have large-company experience are often better qualified for positions in medium-sized and smaller companies, where they will prosper and have a greater impact.</p>\n<p><em>Equity with a Track Record-</em> No disrespect to the biotech, Internet, and telecom startups that produce instant millionaires with their IPOs, but the subsequent 80% stock plunges have proven that the bloom is off the rose for many. Major corporations are rocks. Their stocks have been around for years and they provide more security over the long term. Options, if offered frequently, can be the major wealth provider in your life and should be considered when making your decision. Granted, the stock may not post huge gains, but it promises to be less volatile over the long run. Many companies do restrict stock grants rather than options, so there will always be some value to the equity grants.</p>\n<p><em>Visibility, Skills Transferability, and Recruitability</em>&#8211; The top players at successful, big companies are well-known within the industry and coveted by other companies. Their skills are transferable to companies of all sizes, and they are often needed to fill top positions (including CEO) of smaller firms and pre-IPO startups. It&#8217;s extremely rare that a person trained in a smaller company can secure a senior level position in a major company at the corporate level.</p>\n<p><strong>The Entrepreneurial Route</strong></p>\n<p>Coming straight out of management consulting, attaining CEO in the first job is &#8220;not gonna happen&#8221; in a major corporation; however, it could be offered in a smaller firm (especially in a client from management consulting days) or a startup. Although a bit risky, you have to consider it if:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">1. You run the show, or at the very least the day-to-day as COO, with a great CEO or VC firm behind the effort;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">2. It is in a true growth industry;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">3. It is well capitalized;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">4. You get a &#8220;boatload&#8221; of equity (including grants as well as options).</p>\n<p>A &#8220;sign-on bonus&#8221; is a plus, and a contract (with a severance agreement) is also extremely important. But you have to think &#8220;two years max to pay dirt&#8221; (see Two-Year Rule below) or your career could be in serious jeopardy.</p>\n<p>Well-known entrepreneurs like Michael Dell, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg had an idea, took a chance, and became legends. They had their fate in their own hands and made an impact right from the start. Some of the original people with them made fortunes, and the first wave of hires was set for life.</p>\n<p>The next several tiers of entrepreneurs who started and run mid-sized and smaller but successful companies aren&#8217;t quite as wealthy (not that they have to fly with non-refundable tickets). And the second and third layers of management are probably comfortable, but not rich. Of course, if these smaller companies are acquired, there is a windfall for the owners, but the others have only moderate cash-outs.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s the bottom line here? Starting your own company is one path to CEO, but if your startup doesn&#8217;t become a Microsoft, Dell, or Facebook, don&#8217;t count on earning millions of dollars. In fact, the money you make at a modestly successful startup probably won&#8217;t be any greater than you are making now as a management consultant.</p>\n<p><strong>Narrowing the Choices</strong></p>\n<p>You have the skills, and you have the résumé. So how do you choose a new job? When making your decision, the most important point to remember is to control your own destiny by continuing to construct those building blocks. By doing so, you continue to keep the majority of your options open. Take a job that opens more doors through functional and managerial skill enhancement. Some things to consider:</p>\n<p><em>Industry</em>&#8211; For large companies, almost any industry can provide an excellent career for the management consultant. Of course, if you had an industry specialization as a consultant, you have a decided advantage going with a major player in that field. For non-specialists, consider industries with long track records of growth (consumer, financial services, pharmaceutical, computers, some manufacturing), or those poised for growth in the new economy (telecom, Internet, media, biotech, health care, etc.), both of which have a corresponding stock appreciation. Although it&#8217;s generally perceived to be easier to transfer skills from product to service-based firms, those barriers are now coming down (for example, ex-McKinsey consultant Lou Gerstner trained in service, then ran both a food and a computer / services company).</p>\n<p><em>Position</em>&#8211; This decision may be among the toughest you have to make. It generally comes down to a staff versus line job, with the compromise being a line job in a functional area. All are solid choices if there is a track record of promotion from these positions into senior management. You&#8217;ve got three basic ways in:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">1. Strategy- A strategy position often leads to a promotion into a functional or general management line position in an operating unit, or into a more senior, corporate role. But each company is different. To get an idea where you may land, find out where some of the strategy alumni ended up, both within and outside the company.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">2. General Management- Positions in operating units of large companies are attractive, although sometimes harder to obtain. They provide real management and P&amp;L experience. Look for jobs that have a major strategy component, as well as positions that will give you an opportunity to grow. Any position that gives you a chance to make an impact is a definite résumé builder and should be considered at or near the top of the list.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">3. Functional Management- Positions such as Director or Vice President of Marketing, Finance or Operations are excellent jumping off points into general management or very senior functional roles. Look for functional management positions in either corporate or divisional settings that will give you visibility and a chance to make an impact.</p>\n<p><em>Corporate Breadth</em>&#8211; If possible, choose a global company. Working for one will give you valuable knowledge and international experience. The company should also be publicly traded so that you can obtain substantial equity. Privately-held firms can almost never make up for public equity with cash. Your company should have a track record of mentoring and promotion, and a history of innovation and growth. Don&#8217;t consider a turnaround unless it has a new and dynamic CEO, a household brand name with a solid image, or a stellar product. Rising tides lift all ships. Ebbing tides do the opposite.</p>\n<p><em>Reputation and Standing in the Business Community</em>&#8211; Look for recognized leaders and developers of top talent. Has the company produced executives that have gone on to run other companies? Companies like GE, PepsiCo, Ford, P&amp;G, American Express, Disney, and Google have.</p>\n<p><em>Consultant-Friendly</em>&#8211; Groundbreaking may be fun, but it&#8217;s not exactly safe. Go to a company with a track record of promoting management consultants. You&#8217;ll need all the allies you can get. The common bond you share with these potential hiring managers could help you when you go up for the promotion against a non-consultant or an external candidate. And never take a job with a company that has never hired a major management consulting firm. You&#8217;ll most certainly be an outsider there.</p>\n<p><em>The Ability to Make an Impact</em>&#8211; Take a job with clout. To accelerate your career, you&#8217;ll need a position that lets you make a recognizable impact. Visibility to senior management is key, and being in the middle of major issues and corporate initiatives are critical. Strategy roles should have CEO buy-in. General management positions should be within divisions that are important to the company. Functional management jobs should give you the opportunity to make decisions that impact the bottom line.</p>\n<p><em>The Paycheck</em>&#8211; Those dollar signs a potential employer dangles in front of you may look attractive, but you should never take a job based solely on money. What&#8217;s critical is that you position yourself for a senior management role down the road. The difference between a few thousand dollars extra now in a mediocre job, and the millions later in senior management, is worth the wait. Also, if the company is in such a position that it literally has to “buy” talent, there may be deep issues within the organization that will bubble up within a year.</p>\n<p><strong>Giving Yourself An Edge</strong></p>\n<p>Several other key factors can make or break your ascension to CEO. They are often tough to swallow, but while ignoring them may not mean career suicide, it could allow others who do address them to leap ahead of you. Pay attention to the intangibles.</p>\n<p><em>Flexibility</em>&#8211; The aspiring executive has to be flexible to new opportunities. It&#8217;s not good to sit in one job for too long. You become pigeonholed as a specialist. Continued learning is key, and you&#8217;ve got to have a wide range of experience to advance. Ask for and even welcome change.</p>\n<p>Travel- If you want to run the company one day, you&#8217;ve got to meet the people that make it up. And that means travel &#8211; lots of it. Plan to visit operating units and attend important meetings and conferences. You want to encourage travel, not discourage it, even if it means occasionally being away from the family at inconvenient times. If you don’t have a family, use your flexibility to your advantage now, and you can move your travel into maintenance mode if / when you later start a family.</p>\n<p><em>Relocation</em>&#8211; You may be attached to the place you live, but to move up, you have to be willing to move on. You&#8217;ve got to go where the company needs you. Stay open to relocation and try to grab at least one international assignment during your career. The family may not like moving around, but on the plus side, your kids will probably turn out more well-rounded, and you&#8217;ll have had a chance to see new places on an expat package. The right expat assignment can make your lifestyle essentially “free.”</p>\n<p><em>Positioning Moves-</em> Everyone hates to go laterally, but sometimes it&#8217;s the most important move. Be prepared to move if it puts you in line for a great job two years down the road. Senior managers can ostensibly do parts of every major job in the organization. If you lack experience in a major functional area, you may be passed over for someone with a more diverse background.</p>\n<p><em>Title vs. Substance vs. People Management</em>&#8211; Titles may look nice on a business card but opt for substance every time. Does it really make sense to become CFO or General Manager of a small business, when your goal is to become CEO of a larger company? Probably not, because you&#8217;ll miss out on the scale of a larger company. Managing people is important, but not if the job isn&#8217;t a building block to the next level of your career.</p>\n<p><em>It&#8217;s a Job and Your Career: &#8220;Fun is for the Feeble-Minded&#8221;</em>&#8211; While fun would be nice in your next job, it should never be put ahead of career considerations. Fun is for after work and on weekends, and success in the job buys you fun. Your lifestyle may get easier, and you may never again have the insane hours consulting brought, but save the fun for non-working hours if it conflicts with your quest for CEO. Besides, if you are tracking toward CEO properly, the fun will be built into the interesting nature of your assignments and the excitement of building your career.</p>\n<p><strong>Time Frames</strong></p>\n<p>By the time you come out of management consulting you usually have a minimum of five to ten years of pre- and post-MBA experience. So how long should it take to make senior management?</p>\n<p>Plan on working a total of about 20 years before reaching CEO. In a Fortune 100 company, the time frame could be as long as 25-30 years, although Divisional COO / CEO will come earlier. In a medium-sized company, coming out of a major corporate environment, you could achieve COO / CEO in around 15 years.</p>\n<p>Given these parameters, you can&#8217;t waste a lot of time making mistakes. Your first job out of consulting is critical to putting you on the right path, and it has to be with a company that will mentor and promote you, in a job with impact, visibility, and support from senior management. You&#8217;ve got to cover all functional areas in the next ten plus years and have at least one job that includes P&amp;L responsibility with a large constituency underneath you.</p>\n<p>Before you become CEO, you&#8217;ll probably be President or COO. Typically, you need to run day-to-day operations before you can plan a strategy for the whole corporation. The position prior to COO will likely be as a divisional President or Executive Vice President of a functional area, such as marketing, sales, finance or operations. Target these positions for career development, beyond your first move out of management consulting.</p>\n<p><strong>A Few Other Important Things To Know</strong></p>\n<p>While Training, Bigger is Better- Every company, large or small, will be attracted to an executive who has trained in a successful, large company environment. The scale is huge, the systems are more comprehensive, and the level of impact and visibility is tops. You can usually move up a notch from one major to another, or take the quantum leap to CEO in a smaller environment. But it is extremely rare that a person trained in a smaller company can secure a senior-level position in a major company at the corporate level. A smaller division is possible, but situations where small company executives became large company CEOs are extremely rare.</p>\n<p>The Two-Year Rule- In general, your most recent two years of experience are most relevant when being considered as a candidate for a position. Building blocks of the past, which got you to where you are now, don&#8217;t count as much, so it&#8217;s critical that each move is upward (or positioning) on the CEO track. If you take a chance, and if it doesn&#8217;t work within two years, don&#8217;t make the same mistake twice. Get back on the large corporate career track quickly.</p>\n<p>If you opt to work for a venture capital firm, you may be considered more as a deal maker than a consultant after two years. By this point, you&#8217;ll have lost part of the identity you earned in management consulting. Many times, if you want to get to corporate, you have to take a step back to the level you were when you went into VC. It&#8217;s a big risk if you want to be a CEO someday.</p>\n<p>The same goes for pre-IPO and smaller company jobs with great titles. If your company is like most and fails or tops out early, the best thing to do is get back on the large corporate track within two years. If you don&#8217;t, your judgment may be questioned. Think about it. Does a senior executive want to take a chance on a person with questionable decision-making capabilities? Probably not.</p>\n<p>Never Make an Emotional Career Decision- Listen to your head, not your heart. Make no mistake: a compromise or two based on emotion can knock you off the CEO career track. And you may not know it until it&#8217;s too late. Look carefully at every opportunity.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>The key to success is to construct your career with the right building blocks, which allow you to control your own destiny at the times when it counts. You can do that now if you take the correct fork in the road. To become CEO of a major company – unless it is that unbelievable, &#8220;can&#8217;t miss startup&#8221; opportunity now as CEO / COO – the rule of thumb is:</p>\n<p>Stay with the big firms for your whole career until CEO, or until you can:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">&#8211; Jump off into a CEO role of magnitude at another firm</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">&#8211; Control your new firm&#8217;s destiny</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">&#8211; Secure a major equity position</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t give into the temptation of the quick buck or job title. Take the high road to career maximization, personal stability, and financial security.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<hr />\n<p><strong>Ray Held (ex-Booz Allen Hamilton), currently CFO, Kellogg de Mexico:</strong></p>\n<p>Here’s a throwback for you. We sat down with Ray Held, current CFO of Kellogg Mexico, in 2001 when he was a Director of Global Strategy for the company. In 2002, he became Kellogg’s General Manager in Korea, and in 2005 he became the Vice President of International New Business Development for Kellogg. His strategy remains relevant and offers a window into the mindset of a seasoned consultant who was ready to accomplish more. Here are his insights:</p>\n<p><em>When did you decide it was the right time to leave consulting?</em></p>\n<p>I actually thought about leaving a few years before I started a search. I stayed in consulting to get international experience. I worked in Brazil for about a year and a half.</p>\n<p><em>How would you describe your search process?</em></p>\n<p>Really, it was just an accident. I was bored, feeling unchallenged at work and was doing a competitive piece for Andersen, looking at some of the up and comers. US Web was one that I was profiling and I clicked on “Jobs.” I applied and got a call back.</p>\n<p><em>What prompted your search?</em></p>\n<p>International experience was no longer a good enough trade-off. It was basically a lifestyle issue. I, like a lot of people in consulting, think the job is outstanding, and if you have the make up for it, it’s hard to replicate it anywhere. But the problem is that it’s all-consuming. In terms of balance, you get a piece of your life that is totally optimized and the rest is not getting as much attention. For me, it was the birth of my second child. I was missing all the life changes in her that I missed in my first child. It just forced the decision.</p>\n<p><em>How did you organize your search?</em></p>\n<p>Well, the first thing I did was review the 25 headhunters that had contacted me over the years and pick the five I was most impressed with. I contacted them and basically said, “I’m ready to start looking. What do you have on your plate?”</p>\n<p><em>And was that fruitful?</em></p>\n<p>Yes. Within two or three months, I had five or six job interviews.</p>\n<p><em>What were you looking for in a new career? Were you targeting the consumer products sector?</em></p>\n<p>No, I actually wasn’t. What I was looking for was basically transitioning into general management. And so at the point I was leaving consulting, I figured I had enough on my resume to show people I could think my way out of a paper bag. But I wanted to transition into something to show people I could also manage. I was looking for basically what I found, something that was a business development or strategic development role that offered a quick transition into line management.</p>\n<p><em>Besides recruiters, what resources did you use in the process?</em></p>\n<p>I used headhunters for information. The best way to get beyond that is general networking. I had friends who left Booz-Allen and I knew what they had gone through and what had worked for them. They had experiences with some of the companies that I was interviewing with.</p>\n<p><em>Did you use any of the services offered by Booz-Allen (now “Booz &amp; Company”)?</em></p>\n<p>I know Booz-Allen has improved the services they offer and even at the time that I was working they had an outplacement service. The feeling you always have at consulting firms is that they are primarily focused on people who get counseled out. Since I wasn’t ready to announce that I was leaving and I had no idea how long it would take, I did not use Booz-Allen’s services.</p>\n<p><em>How long did the process take?</em></p>\n<p>It took about three months from the time I started contacting headhunters. I think I accepted an offer in the fourth month.</p>\n<p><em>Did you encounter any challenges during the interview process?</em></p>\n<p>My biggest challenge was managing the whole process while living in Brazil and interviewing with U.S. companies. I had quite a few three-day weekends of painful travel trying not to let Booz-Allen know that I was looking and still get to an interview prepared. The companies that I interviewed with were screening for somebody with my experience so they knew what they were getting. A lot of their screening was for somebody who could be more than a brain on a stick and have potential for line management.</p>\n<p><em>How did you demonstrate that you had line management potential?</em></p>\n<p>Well, I actually had managed large groups. I was fortunate to have had a couple of projects that were longer-term change management programs where I could talk about some of the day-to-day issues that a line manager faces.</p>\n<p><em>How did you decide to join Kellogg’s?</em></p>\n<p>My finalists were Kellogg’s and General Electric for two very different reasons. GE, if not the best, had historically been one of the best companies in terms of self-branding opportunities. They turned out outstanding managers. They had the brand name. Two years down the road if things didn’t work out, it would still be a great resume builder. Kellogg’s, on the other hand, was basically a large corporation in turnaround mode. So I was trading off what was a no-risk opportunity versus one which was still higher risk but offered better opportunities to do things much more quickly. It was a tough decision.</p>\n<p><em>If you had to do the search process again, is there anything you would have done differently?</em></p>\n<p>I think that what I didn’t do well was cover the upfront industry research piece. I’m sure a lot of people leaving consulting now are going for e-commerce or high tech. I really didn’t do a comprehensive search on where various industries would be in five years and which ones would take me farther faster.</p>\n<p><em>What are your current responsibilities?</em></p>\n<p>I work in global strategy development. We are a small group of resources that are allocated across the globe, focusing on big problems or big opportunities. I have been working directly with Brazil since the day I started. I first developed a strategy to grow this business, ten times multiple growth in the next five years, and then worked on business development, acquisition strategy, product launches, and joint ventures. It ends up being a nice balance. I’m still doing a lot of the intellectual content that I got out of consulting, but I get to play in the day-to-day stuff as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<hr />\n<p>Consulting is all about incredibly rational, logical people – really smart people who are driven and persuaded by the argument, by facts. The real world isn’t like that.</p>\n<p>Gary Matthews, Managing Director and Operating Partner at Morgan Stanley Private Equity, should know. The real world is something he has learned to negotiate with remarkable success. He sat down with us to talk about his consulting experience at McKinsey, the pitfalls of moving into corporate management, and the keys to his post-consulting rise to CEO and beyond.</p>\n<p>Gary Matthews knew early on in life that he wanted to be a management consultant, and he planned his career accordingly. After graduating from Princeton in 1980, he spent four years in an “academy” company – Procter &amp; Gamble – where he honed his skills in their brand management development program. Procter &amp; Gamble, like investment banking and management consulting firms, provided an excellent training ground for a future attendee of a top business school.</p>\n<p>Matthews attended Harvard Business School, where he graduated with his MBA in 1986. He spent the next five years at McKinsey &amp; Company, working with several consumer goods companies and doing strategy work for non-packaged goods clients. This strategy of diversification has served him well in his career after consulting, and he does not necessarily recommend developing a specialization as a consultant, “unless you love telecom, or oil and gas, or banking, and you see yourself going into that industry.”</p>\n<p>“I probably had 10 or 11 clients in my five years at McKinsey. Now as a manager, I am less intrigued by somebody who specialized and stayed with the same client for a year to 18 months. If you’re in your first five years [in management consulting], you’re better off with a broad range of experience and clients. You may decide you want to become Partner, and then you’ll need to have that big client or two and stay with them, but up until then it’s like college. If you had to give a freshman advice, you’d say, ‘Take a bunch of courses and don’t worry about deciding on a major until you have to as a junior.’”</p>\n<p>Matthews knew by his “junior year” (three years into his consulting career) that if he intended to become a CEO, he was not going to stay on the Partner track, so he began to look around for a company that could help him put the next solid building block of his career into place. “If you’re two, three, four years into consulting and you’re thinking about management, hook up at the end of your consulting career with a great company that hires consultants and therefore appreciates the value of consultants, and find a mentor within that situation. It doesn’t matter if you go into finance, marketing, or manufacturing – what matters is that it’s a great company that appreciates its employees.”</p>\n<p>“I think you’re more likely to get these points satisfied at a large company,” he continues. “Large companies with great reputations are more likely to hire consultants, and you’re more likely to get good training and to find a great mentor. Could you find a small company that meets those requirements? It’s possible, but it’s a higher risk because there’s no steady career progression. Small companies deal with a whole different set of issues and require a very different skill set, which people should realize – it’s another step further removed from the McKinsey client.”</p>\n<p>Matthews chose to take a role as Vice President of Marketing at Pepsi Cola International. When Pepsi sold off its Wine and Spirits Division, he moved into a Vice President of Corporate Strategic Planning role, which gave him an overview of the company and punched his ticket for a more meaningful role within it – Vice President of Marketing at Frito Lay, one of the company’s most successful businesses.</p>\n<p>“One of the biggest challenges consulting people have,” he says, “is bridging the gap from being able to diagnose and develop a plan for a business to actually implementing it. One of the lessons I learned at Pepsi was that having a great plan is only half the battle – if you don’t implement it, it doesn’t make any difference. McKinsey teaches you to solve the problem and win the minds of people; what Pepsi taught me was how to win their hearts and bellies.”</p>\n<p>With a foundation in marketing at P&amp;G and problem-solving at McKinsey, Matthews gained additional marketing and planning experience at Pepsi, but had no specific operations, human resources, or large scale management background. He was able, however, to convert his exceptional functional experience into a line role, and was tapped to run Guinness Import Company in Stamford, CT. After a successful tenure there, he became CEO of Guinness U.K., the first American ever to hold the position.</p>\n<p>Having made it to the top, Matthews found the challenges new and vast. “There was a lot of learning on the job,” he says. “But the successful general managers, by definition, can’t be good at everything. They have two or three significant strengths they can leverage – marketing, strategy, R&amp;D, finance, operations – and then if they’re going to be really successful, they find business situations where those strengths are the key success makers. In my case, marketing and strategy skills were particularly useful at Pepsi, Guinness, Bristol-Myers, and Sleep Innovations. They might have been less visible if I was running a distributorship, or if these had been manufacturing or cost-driven organizations, so part of it is knowing your skills and matching them with industries or companies in need of those skills. Then you work on covering your blind spots by bringing in phenomenal people to shore up those positions. You create your team, because you can’t spend your life being someone you’re not.”</p>\n<p>Another CEO position with major dot-com era incentives at the Derby Cycle Corporation, the world’s largest branded bicycle manufacturer, led to his next position at Bristol-Myers Squibb, where as President of Worldwide Consumer Medicines he drew from the range of skills he has honed throughout his career, from consulting to CEO. There are many factors that make up success, but “patience” and “people” were the two words that came up again and again throughout our conversation:</p>\n<p>“It’s all about people,” he says. “It’s all about winning their bellies and collecting a great team. Coming out of McKinsey, you realize that not everybody’s brilliant, not everybody has a great skill set, and not everybody has a great attitude – so finding those people who share your values is incredibly important. As a manager, this becomes your greatest challenge, so it’s essential to find a recruiter who gets to know your standards and who can add value over the years.”</p>\n<p><strong>For more:</strong></p>\n<p>Six key CEO characteristics beyond those typical of consultants | the traits that can separate a top performing consultant from the C-Suite.</p>\n<p>From Management Consulting to CEO: The Fork in the Road | the different paths to get you from point A to point B.</p>\n<p>Great places to be versus great places to be from | what to consider re: your next opportunity to set yourself up for success.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<hr />\n<p>By Bruce Raines</p>\n<p><strong>John Wilen (ex-Bain), Former Corporate Vice President of Strategic Planning, PepsiCo, Inc. Worldwide Snacks:</strong></p>\n<p>When he graduated from Dartmouth in 1980, John Wilen set a most improbable goal for himself: retire by age 40. Wilen, however, would miss the mark by two years.</p>\n<p>He retired at 38.</p>\n<p>John Wilen was a deft manager, a master planner, and most importantly, a whiz when it came to his own money. His life is a blueprint for consultants looking to break into management and for those hoping to climb to the top of the corporate ladder, then effortlessly walk away.</p>\n<p>When Wilen graduated from Dartmouth in only three years, having taken many Advanced Placement courses in high school, his work experience consisted of little more than a paper route. Nonetheless, Wilen decided to pursue a graduate degree, and Stanford Business School accepted the rising star. At just 20 years old, Wilen was on his way.</p>\n<p>20 years until retirement and counting.</p>\n<p>Wilen wanted to earn an MBA and eventually try his hand at consulting. He put off school for two years, and with Stanford’s help, he began interviewing with consulting firms such as Bain &amp; Company, BCG, and McKinsey, among others.</p>\n<p>Wilen settled on Bain. The firm was small – only 120 employees – had a quiet, almost secretive feel, and was barely seven years old. He worked for two years as a Research Associate while he earned his MBA, and Wilen says the years there were perhaps the most exciting of his life. The work was exhilarating, the people were amazing, and Wilen acquired valuable skills in data research, data analysis, and business presentation and delivery.</p>\n<p>Starting work in the fall of 1980 was ideal, as it almost perfectly coincided with the start of a great bull market that would last for nearly 20 years. For two years Wilen funneled his excess cash into stocks, poured $2,000 into an IRA each year and vowed to do the same every year going forward.</p>\n<p>18 years to retirement and counting.</p>\n<p><strong>Bain Boomerang</strong></p>\n<p>Wilen returned to Bain full-time after school as a Consultant and made Manager in a short two years. His responsibilities grew rapidly, and Wilen was soon considered an “old-timer.” During these four years, Wilen never considered working anywhere else; he was having too much fun. His whole life had been geared toward creatively solving problems, setting and making goals, and being surrounded by smart people, which in this case included Mitt Romney as one of his bosses, and Meg Whitman, the current CEO of HP, as a colleague. Consulting fit his needs perfectly, and he was getting recognition from clients and Bain for a job well done. Where else would somebody pay him, at age 26, to manage three different clients simultaneously in the Midwest, Beverly Hills, and Hawaii?</p>\n<p>14 years to retirement and counting.</p>\n<p><strong>An Unusual Client</strong></p>\n<p>A year into his tenure as Manager, Wilen was given a plum assignment for Pilkington, a large glass and construction company. Pilkington also had an ophthalmic division called Visioncare that made glass and plastic lenses. Visioncare was moving its headquarters from Australia to the U.S. as a result of several relatively large acquisitions, and Wilen was to oversee the integration. His work was well received, and a year later, Wilen was offered a job at Visioncare as its VP, Strategic Planning. The offer was too good to turn down, and a new stage of his career had begun at age 28.</p>\n<p>12 years to retirement and counting.</p>\n<p><strong>An Offer He Couldn’t Refuse</strong></p>\n<p>At Bain, Wilen had been a star. Each year brought more responsibility, more prestige and, of course, more money. So why did he leave?</p>\n<p>The opportunity with Visioncare was unusual, and Wilen liked the startup feel of the company. Visioncare’s CEO had also promised Wilen a line / operating job within three years. Wilen also knew that it would be an advantage to leave Bain on a high note, while his career trajectory was soaring. After all, one never knows whose path you might cross later in life.</p>\n<p>But Wilen says one of the reasons he left is that he was just tired of consulting and was ready for new challenges. “Consulting doesn’t give you a chance to operate or manage anything. You’re managing a bunch of young people solving analytical problems. That’s a lot different than manufacturing, marketing, and selling a product or service,” Wilen says. The job at Visioncare would allow Wilen to capitalize on his consulting skills and direct them into a single company and industry. It was the attraction of depth over consulting’s breadth of experience that ultimately lured him away.</p>\n<p>Just 18 months later at age 29, Wilen was promoted to President of SOLA’s International Division, Visioncare’s largest and most profitable operating company.</p>\n<p>11 years to retirement and counting.</p>\n<p><strong>Shifting Into High Gear</strong></p>\n<p>Under Wilen’s leadership, SOLA had three consecutive years of record sales, earnings, and cash flow. And the company grew to become the market-share leader. Then in late 1993, Pilkington began to dismantle Visioncare. For Wilen, it was time to move on.</p>\n<p>Joining Visioncare / SOLA was an invaluable experience, and one that Wilen never regretted. He says the jump from consulting to management isn’t that difficult. “If you were a good consultant, you should end up being a good strategic planning person.” But the change can be rough at first. “When you go into a company, it’s not like you and your staff have an eighty-hour week to work on a problem,” he says. “You have all these other things to do that are part of the company that you didn’t have to do when you were a consultant. There are a lot of Human Resources issues.” Wilen says there are some things a consultant can do to prepare. “Work more as a line manager while you’re a consultant, for example, in change management projects. Try to do more of the implementation, almost as if you worked for the company,” Wilen says. “Use any opportunity that you can to actually get embedded in the company.”</p>\n<p>Wilen says moving from strategic planning into executive management is sometimes more difficult. “I still have scars,” he says. “It is not something you can learn in business school or from consulting. The reason is that as a line executive, at least in my case, you are less worried about strategic issues and much more worried about Human Resources and financial issues.”</p>\n<p><strong>Crunch Time: The World of Salty Snacks</strong></p>\n<p>In April 1994, with the help of an ex-partner at Bain with whom Wilen had worked years earlier, Wilen joined PepsiCo as Corporate Vice President of Strategic Planning, Worldwide Snacks. He was just 34 and was easily the youngest officer at the company. PepsiCo provided Wilen with a healthy stock options package, but the biggest draw was an attractive deferred compensation program that Wilen soon realized could be the key to his early retirement plan.</p>\n<p>Six years to retirement and counting.</p>\n<p><strong>How To Retire Safe, Wealthy, &amp; Happy</strong></p>\n<p>During his four years at PepsiCo, Wilen didn’t take a dime in salary or bonus. Wilen had traveled the world at SOLA, and was able to save money during his three years there, in addition to making some excellent real estate investments. This provided living expense money for the ensuing four years, and he chose to defer 100% of his pay at PepsiCo, investing it in an S&amp;P 500 index fund. Instead of having nearly half his salary taken in taxes, Wilen’s money grew quickly. “Before you know it,” he says, “your money is working for you, not the other way around.”</p>\n<p>“Some relatively simple math shows you are better off using funds you have already accumulated and paid tax on to meet living expenses, than to lose up to 50% or more of new, current income to taxes,” Wilen says. “It can even be wiser, under certain circumstances, to borrow to meet peak expense requirements than to accept current salary. And because deferring, in effect, is a forced savings plan, it better positions one for retirement as the funds are not temptingly available for frivolous spending.”</p>\n<p>His planning had paid off. At age 38, Wilen left PepsiCo – and the working world – for good. His financial plan had worked, and he was able to retire with enough accumulated wealth to live comfortably off his investments. And he was two years early.</p>\n<p>Wilen has been out of the “jungle” almost 14 years now, and has never regretted leaving. At first, his time was spent tackling something far more difficult than cost projections or branding: golf. Wilen played three times a week initially with other retirees, and must have smiled at how much older the other players were. Over the years he has pursued other hobbies which include fixed income investments and wine. He is an expert at both. He writes articles for several bond media outlets, and is a frequent visitor to Napa Valley, where he has befriended many of the owners of the area’s best “boutique” wineries specializing in Cabernet Sauvignon.

      "content": "<hr />\n<p><em>A Raines International interview on compensation with Chris Kempczinski, BCG alum, who joined PepsiCo out of consulting and is now SVP, U.S. Grocery Division at Kraft Foods.</em></p>\n<p><strong>When you were a management consultant, how did you envision your compensation would change after you left the consulting world?</strong></p>\n<p>I expected that my compensation would go down in the long-term, because I knew that even if I was a senior person at a corporation, I wouldn’t make as much as a Partner in a consulting firm. But I did figure that, given my tenure, I could probably net out at about even, in terms of where I was at that stage in my career.</p>\n<p><strong>In addition to compensation, what other factors were you looking for in a new position?</strong></p>\n<p>I wanted to make more of a tangible impact with my work, where I could really feel that I was not only contributing to the decision, but also seeing it through to completion. I think that if you are the type of person who likes to have very tangible signs of accomplishment, you will get that out of a position with an industry or corporation. You also get more of a sense that you’re on a team. Whereas the teams are always changing in consulting, you are not working with the same people, and you don’t really get that sense of “We’re all in this together.”</p>\n<p><strong>What “quality of life” issues, if any, affected your decision?</strong></p>\n<p>The fact that you travel less in an industry job than you do in the consulting world was a definite pro for me. And while the hours, so far, have been about comparable, you have to take into account the fact that you are usually working in town.</p>\n<p><strong>What, if any, of your compensation needs were you willing to compromise?</strong></p>\n<p>For me, a position would have been less attractive if I couldn’t have been kept relatively “whole,” but as long as my new compensation was in the same ballpark, I was comfortable with that. Let’s just say that compensation was certainly a key consideration, but it wasn’t <em>the</em> consideration.</p>\n<p><strong>What negotiation advice can you offer current management consultants who are considering a move from consulting to industry?</strong></p>\n<p>My advice is that it’s always better to have two companies bidding over you than one. You’re in a much stronger negotiation position if you’re able to walk away from the opportunity. Having something to walk away to becomes a pretty strong piece of leverage.</p>\n<p>Also, take into account whether or not you really want to leave your job. I was in a situation where I was totally content with my current position – as a management consultant – when another company, MyWay.com, tried to recruit me away. In that case, it wasn’t that I was leveraging two different positions, but since I was happy with my job at that point, I was perfectly willing to take a pass on MyWay if they didn’t meet my compensation criteria.</p>\n<p><strong>What was it like leaving the consulting world for an Internet startup?</strong></p>\n<p>It was certainly different, but it was exciting because it was very fast-paced. I had a lot more autonomy and was making a lot of decisions, so to a certain extent it was much more entrepreneurial than consulting.</p>\n<p><strong>How should current management consultants view compensation in terms of the whole opportunity being offered to them?</strong></p>\n<p>I think it depends on the individual situation. You have to ask yourself questions like, “Do you have kids, don’t you have kids?” “Are you married, are you single?” “Do you have a high-cost lifestyle, or a low-cost lifestyle?” I think when it comes to compensation, it’s really a person-to-person issue.</p>\n<p><strong>If anything, what would you have done differently in your compensation negotiations?</strong></p>\n<p>This question applies more for when I was working at MyWay.com, not to my current situation. I think it’s essential when going to a dot-com that you make sure that you adjust the value of your options, and realize that they are not the same thing as cash.</p>\n<p><strong>For more:</strong></p>\n<p>Corporate Compensation Guide | the different components that make up a corporate compensation package (and what you should consider with each).</p>\n<p>2012 Compensation Study | our analysis of offers made to consultants recruited in 2012, including a look at the actual compensation packages themselves.</p>\n<p>Retire Before 40 | how Bain alum John Wilen retired at the age of 38.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "<p class=\"profile-intro\">Position: CHRO and Chief of Staff</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">Current Firm: LivePerson</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\">*At the time of this interview Kristy was the Senior Vice President of a government non-profit organization for economic development.</p>\n<p class=\"profile-intro\"><em>You left Oliver Wyman as an Associate Partner after almost ten years with the firm. How did you choose the right time to move out of consulting (why not earlier)?</em></p>\n<div class=\"profile-intro\">\n<p>My move out of Oliver Wyman was more one of opportunity, and I was not actively looking at the time I decided to leave consulting. At that point, I had 10 years of consulting experience and a developed industry focus in media and technology, and I went on sabbatical working with my current not-for-profit to build their tech / media team. When I was offered the role to stay and help launch additional industry teams, I was really excited about the opportunity to expand my management experience and broaden my industry exposure and network. I was also attracted to the leadership at the nonprofit – the culture was one of innovation and entrepreneurism, and I had the chance to implement my strategy recommendations rather than just making them to clients.</p>\n<p><em>Leaving consulting at the Associate Partner level, what kinds of positions were you targeting? What advice would you give consultants who are looking to transition at a similar level?</em></p>\n<p>For consultants leaving at the Associate Partner or Partner level, I would make sure that you are entering your company at the right level / a similar level. Pay attention to the seniority of the position and the amount of resources you are given to do the work, and have a real understanding of the role, the path, and the opportunities it provides. Some consultants want to continue to be strategists in their subsequent roles – for me, I knew I wanted to continue with strategy but have a more hands-on element to my work.</p>\n<p><em>Working in government, could you elaborate on the pace and culture of your organization compared to what you’ve seen or heard about at other organizations? In broader terms, could you point to some pros and cons of being in the public sector today?</em></p>\n<p>For government, there is always the impression that it is bureaucratic, highly regulated, and slow-moving. In general, the private sector attracts the talent that not every single public sector organization can offer, and the way that people make decisions in corporate heightens the pace of their implementation. The pay also tends to be much higher in private. That being said, with the right leadership you can make a huge impact in government, on the scale of a city to the entire country in some cases. Dynamic leaders can convince talent to give up the paycheck and work toward their vision. Not dissimilar to corporate, look for the champions that will help accomplish goals and push them through.</p>\n<p>You also have to appreciate and understand the larger picture, as government is more focused on long-term goals rather than “making your numbers.” A large benefit of what I do today is that making a positive contribution to society is built into my job – it is a good feeling to know I am changing the way society / a city functions for the better.</p>\n<p><em>As Head of Industry Transformation for your organization, you consult different areas of the business sector about their overall operations and possibilities for growth. How is this similar to serving as an external management consultant or working in an internal strategy role for an organization?</em></p>\n<p>My organization acts like the industry strategist to the city. Similar to a strategy consultant, we understand the industry trends, do industry research, benchmarking, etc. Our interests in the companies’ and industry’s operations and growth opportunities are driven by their potential impacts on economic development for the city. What is different is that once we have the go-ahead, we implement the recommendations we propose – when the Mayor announces it, we immediately put together a team to implement the initiative.</p>\n<p><em>How was the switch from managing teams of consultants at Oliver Wyman to your current team with the government?</em></p>\n<p>From my personal experience, managing a P&amp;L of 30 people has been very different than owning three teams of five people in consulting. In consulting, you are often surrounded by very smart, focused, bottom-line / commercially driven, and typically Type A individuals with similar attitudes / goals. In government, you have a diverse set of talent with different drivers and motivations, and the teams are not constantly changing like they are with the consulting model. It is a great opportunity to develop a longer term management style and perspective, as you learn how to get the most out of the people you are working with. You have to balance their interests so that they are developing and want to stay at your firm. For example, with my team, I look at the amount of strategy-versus-implementation projects a person has, or what specific industries each member prefers to work with.</p>\n<p>There is also a certain lack of control in consulting, because the client does not necessarily have to work with you or take your recommendations. In my role today, I do a lot of private / public joint-sector work where I interact with people from both areas in order to actually execute projects. It has taught me how to build and manage relationships in order to ensure the most productive environment.</p>\n<p><em>Any subtle differences between making recommendations and gaining buy-in with corporate teams versus public sector teams?</em></p>\n<p>In corporate, it is often clear that you are hired to either improve the top or bottom line for a firm, whereas in the public sector, you are also required to focus on how to align with goals / policies. So, in my organization, it is not just about making the most for the city, but about doing what is right for the city in its entirety. It’s a job where you cannot just put on the profitable hat, and you have to consider the larger implications of your actions.</p>\n<p><em>As a leader in a NPO focused on a specific city’s economy and growth, what’s it like living in the city you consult and analyze every day?</em></p>\n<p>It’s been a great and eye opening experience. As a resident, it is hard to see how much is going on to make the city a better and safer place to live. We are constantly working on getting the best talent to come to the city, and the talent here is truly diverse. More than 40 percent of the people here have an international background. Having moved to the city more than a decade ago, I can relate to the issues of the public and how my organization’s projects will affect the population overall.</p>\n<p><em>What are your plans for personal progression and growth? Are you tied to the public sector, or could you move elsewhere?</em></p>\n<p>Personally, I continue to look for opportunities where I can combine strategy, business development, and general management. The combination is very powerful, and consultants who want to move up need to demonstrate these abilities in order to build the credibility that they can execute. As for nonprofit versus for-profit, I would most likely return to the for-profit sector to expand my breadth of experience and strengthen my overall offerings for future roles. However, if there is a strong leadership and exciting opportunity, I would definitely consider another nonprofit opportunity down the road.</p>\n<p><em>What is the most valuable experience you have gained in your current position that you think you could apply in a private sector setting?</em></p>\n<p>The nonprofit / government sector trains you to do more with less and push to the limit of change. The fact that I am able to create innovative strategies and implement them with limited resources in a structurally complex environment makes me feel confident to drive transformation in a variety of different industries.</p>\n<p><em>What do you like best, and least, about your role today? What is the most important skill that makes you successful in your job now?</em></p>\n<p>What I like most about my role today is that I believe I am making an impact – I can see it through the companies we create, the jobs we create, etc. It is truly something tangible. What I like least would have to be the financial downside, as you do give up some of the perks of private sector monetary gains.</p>\n<p>As for a skill that has helped me be successful today, I really think it is the exceptional ability to solve problems and get stuff done. It sounds cliché, but being able to think through problems and recognize practical solutions is something extremely valuable today.</p>\n</div>\n",

      "content": "<div class=\"profile-intro\">\n<p>Position: Chief Executive Officer</p>\n<p>Current Firm: Labvantage Solutions Inc.</p>\n<p>*At the time of this interview Peter was the General Manager of General Electric Healthcare.</p>\n<p><em>You spent four years at McKinsey, leaving as an Engagement Manager for a role within the operational improvement team of General Electric. Why did you decide to leave McKinsey when you did, and what in particular set that role apart from the others you assessed? Did you ever consider the Partner path?</em></p>\n<p>Regarding the Partner path, I had always considered consulting as a way to establish a foundation for a career in more direct operating roles. For my transition, I considered many options, from line management positions to program-based roles like the one I eventually pursued. When assessing the opportunities, I had three main criteria: 1) the reputation of the company for producing leaders, 2) the track record of the specific program or role in leading to true operating leadership roles, and 3) (most importantly) whom I would be working for and with.</p>\n<p><em>Speaking to that transition from consulting to corporate, what were the largest similarities and differences in your experience?</em></p>\n<p>It’s a rare consultant who is going to be an immediate success in the operating world. It takes an adjustment. You have to roll up your sleeves more in corporate, and it’s not always as intellectually stimulating as the CEO-level issues that consultants are used to working with (though it is equally as rewarding in other ways). Sometimes it’s about the day-to-day and more tactical work, which, by virtue of the type of work they do, is something consultants often skip past. You have to get comfortable dealing with challenges that will have more immediate – though not as high-level – impact, and with people who may be directly / immediately affected and with whom you’ll need to continue working. The combination of understanding the smaller challenges along with the grand, overarching strategy will enable you to take apart the abstract and make it personal to each person involved. That is the key to successful execution. Once you prove you can execute, you’ve earned your stripes and then you can get a real seat at the table.</p>\n<p>While both McKinsey and GE, my current company, have solution-driven businesses and cultures, there was also an adjustment in adapting to the different process and pace around finding the right answer. At McKinsey, you assess the options, get to the answer, pressure test it, and find the optimal recommended solution with the luxury of objectivity and focus. In my current company, you decide on a direction and act on it – if it’s wrong, you iterate, and adjust quickly until you get on the right course, but you’d better keep moving forward while you’re at it. McKinsey was about recommending the optimal solution, and my current company is about making a decision, executing, and course-correcting fast.</p>\n<p>What was most comfortable for me in my transition was that, generally speaking, both of the companies are meritocracies, values-driven, and have strong, core performance cultures. If consultants target those kinds of companies, they should be able to find a comfortable home.</p>\n<p><em>The paths to managing a P&amp;L are numerous, and the base experience for those opportunities (through marketing, operations, internal strategy, etc.) can vary widely. Having secured a General Manager position in GE Healthcare by climbing the ranks through operational improvement roles and a stint as a divisional CIO, how do you think those experiences helped you prepare for your position today?</em></p>\n<p>This depends upon the company. In my company, operations is a well-tested path to get to a P&amp;L, with IT being less so as most CIOs tend to be more techie, with less of a “business first” approach (though that is changing quickly). Marketing, while it could work at other companies, tends not to be a path to a P&amp;L at mine, so you have to see what’s appropriate in the business that you are in.</p>\n<p>For my path, I went into my Lean Six Sigma role because it had a track record of producing leaders, and I knew the person I would report to was a true operator looking for his next staff member. The same went for my acquisition integration role. For my stint as CIO, I had actually never wanted that type of role, but was approached about the opportunity as more of a business and leadership challenge. The technology knowledge on the team was strong but not necessarily focused on the same priorities as the business. So, the role entailed building and leading a larger global team than I had led previously, redefining and aligning the tech strategy with business needs, and cutting a whole lot of cost while doing it. Quite a business and leadership challenge indeed!</p>\n<p>Throughout my tenure, a lot of other opportunities have come up that I chose not to pursue. I have been very deliberate in choosing the roles that I felt were consistent with my desired path and fit the story I want to tell.</p>\n<p><em>What would you say is the most important skill that got you where you are today? What did you take specifically from consulting that makes you successful in your job now?</em></p>\n<p>Being able to lead and influence people. At McKinsey, you learn how different people are influenced in different ways, and you gain an understanding of the diverse possibilities of motivation. You can’t tell people what to do. Instead, you learn how to influence the actions of others through the power of persuasion – they must buy into what you’re suggesting and then own it themselves. In corporate, you can tell people what to do to a certain extent, but you won’t gain the same level of commitment or buy-in. It’s really those softer skills that contribute to being able to maneuver in the corporate world.</p>\n<p><em>Having been the General Manager of two different business units at GE, how do you separate a good General Manager opportunity from a great one? How have your experiences differed from one division to the other?</em></p>\n<p>I think it comes down to the amount of leadership support you have and the quality of the team you have or can build. In my last role there was huge energy around what we were doing, and it was a line position in an entrepreneurial area of a much larger company, which I really enjoyed. My specific team was tremendous and doing very well, but the larger parent company started to significantly underperform, so we didn’t have much control over the success of the broader business. The role that I’m in today is great because it is in a growth industry that’s very interesting, and the whole business is growing rather than just my piece of it. The size and structure also gives this team the clear ability to contribute to the overall business success. That, coupled with a lot of support from a great CEO and some excellent professionals on my team – some already in place, some I am hiring – make this a great place to be right now.</p>\n<p><em>You pursued a Master’s in International Relations as a joint degree with your MBA, and also worked abroad both before and during your consulting experience. How has that had an impact, if any, on your professional outlook? How much importance do you give international experience in an executive’s ability to be successful?</em></p>\n<p>I think the role itself determines whether or not international experience has more or less of a direct influence, though roles with no international influence are becoming more and more rare. Independent of this, I think a global outlook and how an individual thinks about his or her global experience helps demonstrate openness, flexibility, empathy, curiosity, adventurousness, etc. That helps define the type of person you are and can be a great differentiator. In my last role, international experience had zero direct impact beyond having shaped me in a general sense, and in my current role there is a great deal of direct impact. The teams I currently manage are mostly outside of the U.S., and with that comes many cultural differences / sensitivities. My previous experience in Europe allowed me to gain credibility with the European teams. I also set up roundtables with our teams in Japan and, because I could participate in Japanese, they were floored by the level at which we could connect and their overall inclusion in the process from that. It went a long way toward building trust.</p>\n<p>When you are hiring someone for your team, it depends on the group reporting into them. I recently hired a global COO with responsibility for establishing our global team and managing our supply chain on an international basis. When it came down to the two final candidates, diverse international experience was the key factor in choosing who we trusted to establish a cohesive / powerful global team. Having said that, recall my earlier point – how a person thinks about their international experience, or lack thereof, can give you interesting insight into that person’s mindset.</p>\n</div>\n",

      "content": "<div class=\"wrap content clear\">\n<p class=\"right full\">Position: Vice President and Head of Client Marketing</p>\n<p class=\"right full\">\n</div>\n<p>Current Firm: Asurion</p>\n<div class=\"wrap content clear\">\n<div class=\"right full\">\n<p><em>You left Booz as a Principal after more than 10 years with the firm. Why did you decide to move into the corporate world at that time in your career (why not earlier)?</em></p>\n<p>My decision to leave Booz was based on two factors. On a personal level, my wife and I had a kid around that time, and I had to reduce my travel. Professionally, I also felt it was the right time to move to corporate. I had 3-4 years of complex implementation and restructuring experience at that point, dealing with multiple issues, larger teams, and tangible financial results. In hindsight, that implementation experience was a very useful complement to my strategy experience during the transition.</p>\n<p><em>You were heavily involved in the automotive and organizational restructuring practices at Booz, and worked across a variety of industries throughout your tenure. How did you decide on a technology / telecom / services company? How much weight did industry have in your decision, and what other factors did you consider?</em></p>\n<p>I didn’t really have a strong preference for one specific industry over another. As far as industry bias is concerned, I knew I wanted to go into an area with high growth and high margins. A high-growth company is exciting, because it provides more opportunities for professional and personal development. When I did transition, I was approached by a company with a unique market position in an unconventional industry vertical – it was high growth and fit the criteria I was looking for. It also just came down to the people. I wanted quality team members, but I also wanted people I would enjoy collaborating with. That was very much a gut feeling.</p>\n<p><em>As a Principal leaving Booz, what kinds of positions were you targeting? What advice would you give consultants at a similar level?</em></p>\n<p>This hinges on your level of line / industry experience prior to consulting. The depth of that prior experience opens up more options to move into key line roles. If your experience is predominantly general management consulting, you could target internal strategy roles or functions that rely heavily on your strategy and consulting skill set. For example, in client marketing, I hire a lot of my senior team members straight from consulting because I value that experience and discipline over the deep industry knowledge. The key premise is to add value immediately.</p>\n<p><em>When considering the different levels that consultants can switch to corporate, you transitioned from a senior level at Booz into a strategy role at Asurion, quickly moving on to lead its North American channel / client marketing. What are the major differences and similarities you’ve noticed between consulting to corporate?</em></p>\n<p>There are definitely some major differences, and because I frequently hire straight from consulting I regularly see the commonalities of the transition. The first difference from consulting to corporate is definitely one of focus. In consulting, at the Job Manager / Associate levels you’re really only working on 1-2 projects max, so you can dive very deep and focus. At the Principal / Partner level, you have 4-5 business development opportunities and 1-2 projects at a time, but again, you’re still relatively focused. Jumping to corporate, you go from what would be a 3 on a scale of 10 to a 7 or 8 in terms of how many diverse issues you are working on at a time – you are constantly multitasking, and the issues differ widely from pure strategy to tactical and “get your hands dirty” topics. It requires you to be very nimble and be able to go with the flow, promptly solving problems from the very important down to the nitty gritty things.</p>\n<p>The second difference between typical general management consulting and corporate is the level of involvement in people management. In management consulting, consultants are often in a pool, and Managers pull from the pool for projects that generally last for a couple of months. There’s less long-term ownership of people, and Managers typically don’t have to deal with a lot of the difficult management issues that come with true reports within an official org structure. In corporate, where there are official reporting structures, you have to figure out how to get the best out of every person on your team – you have to make it work for the long-term and mold / shape individuals. Individual capability will also tend to be less uniform in corporate, which adds to the challenge.</p>\n<p>The third difference is influence, and realizing its dynamics / importance in business. This can be a difficult one for consultants who are used to leveraging their influence at the C-Suite and Board levels during engagements. When you’re in corporate, influence is leveraged differently and in a more balanced way. It is a give and take across functions as well as an exercise in building personal / organizational brand and credibility. For example, you could pull rank maybe once or twice, but it’s more political than that – you’ll get a bad rep very promptly. You have to find different ways to influence the actions of others.</p>\n<p><em>Considering you hire a lot of consultants, do you have any advice for current consultants when they’re interviewing?</em></p>\n<p>For me, I’m looking for someone who can work effectively with others, and is able to sell others on what they’re doing. I’m not looking for a brain on a stick – you need to be smart, but also able to communicate well. I value likability, influencing skills, and horsepower.</p>\n<p>I also like someone who is willing to dive deep and get their hands dirty. For example, in my world, it means getting the copy that the ad agency just sent over and reading every single word to make sure the message is right. Some have been surprised at the level of “keep the business running” activity. I view those tasks as prerequisites that need to be done well and efficiently so that we can focus on larger, strategic items that really move the needle.</p>\n<p><em>With growth being a major focus in your role as Head of Client Marketing, you work at a company that primarily dominates the market. What, if anything, from your consulting experience contributes to how you approach your role?</em></p>\n<p>There are two main things I’ve gotten from consulting that help me in this regard. When you dominate the market, there are a lot of levers you can pull at any time to keep going and winning, but your resources aren&#8217;t limitless, and the more you try to do, the less effective your team will be. What do you do first? Consulting teaches you how to step back, prioritize, and plan. You figure out what’s most important to the overall business, how to affect the change, and the top 2-3 levers you need to focus on.</p>\n<p>The second thing I got from consulting is a detail-oriented and fact-based approach. Given the fast pace of some corporate environments, important decisions may be made on a less than ideal fact base. You need to be able to prioritize the critical decisions, and demand answers around how and why things are a certain way, the key facts, and options.</p>\n<p><em>Asurion is headquartered in Nashville. You are located in Boston. How did you swing that? What are the pros and cons of working remotely? How did you learn to effectively manage people remotely?</em></p>\n<p>My first piece of advice is you have to do it with a company that is very amenable to working remotely – the company culture has to be open to it. At Asurion, the CEO is in one place, the sales team is in another, etc., and everyone is used to working virtually on conference calls or on email. That being said, you also have to pay your dues and put in the face time in your first couple of months, traveling to the key locations to build trust and establish a presence. You can then ease off and travel to maintain relationships, but you also have to be aware of what you lose without face-to-face contact. I know I don’t have the benefit of body language for social cues, so I am extra sensitive to other elements like tones of voice, and I have to read between the lines. You just have to adapt.</p>\n<p><em>You have done extremely well professionally, and you did it all without getting your MBA. Can you please talk a bit about your decision not to get an MBA – pros and cons?</em></p>\n<p>After undergrad, my firm promoted me to a post-MBA role within three years. I subsequently moved back to the U.S. after an international stint, and transitioning and figuring out what to do was made more complicated with the large geographic move. By that time, I was an Engagement Manager, and the opportunity cost of business school was increasing. I guess I was probably lucky and unlucky in that regard, because while I was able to do without it, I missed out on the branding and added network you get from business school.</p>\n<p><em>You spent at least a year in an international location with Booz. Can you talk about that experience?</em></p>\n<p>When I was pitched on a “couple month project near a beach” in a country I’d never been to, I figured “why not” and took the chance to go and work in Indonesia. The project ended up lasting a year, and I essentially lived out of a suitcase for the next 4-5 years after that, working on projects throughout Asia including Thailand, the Philippines, Australia, and Korea. It was a really interesting time to be in Asia – the financial economies were collapsing and there was very challenging work for us in helping large conglomerates optimize their corporate portfolios and restructure businesses. I felt like I was in “Lost in Translation” at times, but it taught me a lot about patience, and about being open minded to different cultures and people.</p>\n<p><em>What do you like best about marketing? Why client marketing specifically?</em></p>\n<p>Client marketing, or channel marketing as most other firms refer to it, is a good stepping stone for consultants. It is very analytical, and requires you to understand growth dynamics to prioritize focus areas: what channels, what geos, what stages of the customer life cycle, etc. You’re dealing with the acquisition and retention side, and it’s just as much about the strategy and prioritization as it is the creative piece of marketing. It’s a function that’s at the intersection of my skills and my interests.</p>\n<p><em>As the leader of client marketing for Asurion, a multi-billion dollar company, what are your goals for professional growth in the future?</em></p>\n<p>For my next step, I’d like to go on to run a business unit. The beauty of client marketing is that I’ve been involved in quite a few aspects of the business, and externally I touch a lot of the channel partners and have had to deal with negotiations, financials, as well as the operations. Client marketing has provided a great base to move on and own / lead all of the key aspects involved in running your own division.</p>\n<p><em>Which of the skills that you gained in consulting has added the most value to your life outside of work?</em></p>\n<p>Can I say it made me appreciate life, time, and family more because I know what it’s like to spend a lot of my time in the airport / office? Kidding…but on a serious note, time management and adaptability are two key things I’ve taken from consulting that I can apply to pretty much anything I do. You’re constantly dealing with different projects, different people, and different clients – you’re always in a state of flux. You learn to just deal with it.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

      "content": "<div class=\"profile-intro\">\n<p>Position: Managing Director</p>\n<p>Current Firm: Pernod Ricard SA</p>\n<p>* At the time of this interview Dave was the Vice President of Strategy at Pernod Ricard SA</p>\n<p><em>You recently left BCG for a VP, Strategy role at Pernod Ricard, a multi-billion dollar wine &amp; spirits company &#8211; what was your experience leaving consulting like, and what is your advice for consultants who are considering a move? For example, you announced to BCG that you were going to leave, and you worked with their Career Services Center. Not all firms offer that – but do you recommend using these services when they are there?</em></p>\n<p>I absolutely recommend using the Career Services Center, and think it’s a huge benefit for the folks who have them on a few levels. First, it’s a form of counseling, providing a floor for discussion where you can bounce your ideas off someone as you are considering a move. There’s also just the basic professional services component, where you can utilize resume editing resources and get help on interview techniques / presence. The third is that, just like in consulting, staying connected brings about a different kind of database – an “unofficial database” that goes much beyond the standard job database at every firm. If you stay well connected, people will think of you and approach you with opportunities and connections you would not have heard of otherwise.</p>\n<p>My other piece of advice is for consultants to absolutely be open and transparent about wanting to move – you need to be decisive and able to pull the trigger (with the caveat of being practical, of course). When you decide what you want and are able to communicate it clearly to people, that’s when you are able to get the most from your resources. When Partners, recruiters, etc., think you’re wishy-washy and don’t actually want to move, they won’t spend the time and effort they would otherwise.</p>\n<p><em>You worked in four of BCG’s major offices (Chicago, New York, Shanghai, and Sydney) during your 6+ years at the company. What (if any) impact do you think it has had on your career?</em></p>\n<p>My international experience has 100% impacted my career. It is absolutely important to have that experience in today’s world &#8211; if you don’t, you will lack credibility and a context to make well-informed business decisions. Until you are outside of the U.S., you don’t really appreciate its size and importance; at the same time, you may also lack a knowledge of its flaws. Taken in terms of operating level, it is also critical at the senior ranks – when you are working with senior executives they want you to be able to talk the same game.</p>\n<p><em>Did you ever consider the Partner path?</em></p>\n<p>I definitely considered the Partner path, and left at a time that is unusual in the typical consultant track. It really came down to the fact that I felt the need to own and deliver something – I knew in the long run that consulting wasn’t something that would wake me up in the morning.</p>\n<p><em>A lot of our readers want to jump right into a P&amp;L role as they leave consulting, passing on strategy roles in hopes of a GM opportunity. Considering your most recent transition, can you help our visitors appreciate the exciting elements of your position and why you chose it over some of your other options?</em></p>\n<p>To put this back into consulting language, if you are a new Project Leader or Associate Principal, you want to go right to Partner – the problem is that you would never learn how to be a good manager. Drawing a parallel to that essential middle step, a corporate strategy role gives you the opportunity to learn the business while staying in your comfort zone. You are able to rely on your strategy fundamentals, and at the same time master the ins and outs of the company you are working for.</p>\n<p>That being said, there is a lot of benefit to jump right to the P&amp;L roles. I would have jumped at the chance if the right opportunity had come along.</p>\n<p><em>From your own experience and knowledge, what separates a great Head of Strategy position from a good Head of Strategy position?</em></p>\n<p>One thing that definitely separates a great strategy role from a good one is the level it sits within an organization. In my job, for example, I report to the CEO, and that functionality is at the right layer for consultants because they are used to working at that level and having a certain amount of influence.  For strategy roles that are folded under a finance or marketing function, those will probably not be as exciting for consultants, and might even feel like a step down compared to the senior interactions they are used to. Another aspect that I feel elevates my role in particular is my responsibility beyond traditional strategic planning – I also have end-to-end innovation and project management for products. Currently, I am following a product from design into completion, which is pretty exciting for two months in.</p>\n<p><em>What would you say is the most important skill that got you where you are today?</em></p>\n<p>If I’m being cheeky, I’d have to say luck…but I also think it has to do with not saying &#8220;no.&#8221; When I was in Australia and had the opportunity to go to Shanghai, my wife and I went “Yea, let’s try that.” You can’t limit your options – you have to be open to get the best opportunities.</p>\n<p><em>Considering your experience within and exposure to different consumer goods companies throughout your career, is there a reason you picked to work in a wine &amp; spirits company in particular? For readers who are considering moving into consumer / retail companies, are there any differences they should consider when looking at the spirits space specifically?</em></p>\n<p>Put simply, I get to go work on wine every day. It’s something I really enjoy because it is a passion of mine. When leaving, you have one major opportunity to follow your passion and do what you want to do – take the time to consider your options and go with what excites you.</p>\n</div>\n",

      "content": "<div class=\"profile-intro\">\n<p>Position: Vice President, Strategy and Corporate Development</p>\n<p>Current Firm: Docusign</p>\n<p>*At the time of this interview Dean was the Chief Executive Officer of Sterling Partners Portfolio Company.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<p><em>Briefly going back to the start of your consulting career, you did a short stint at McKinsey before you climbed the ladder to Partner at Marakon; some of our readers at the Associate level are at the point of considering a switch. What motivated you to change between the two strategy firms?</em></p>\n<p>This was more for personal circumstances. After business school I went back into consulting at McKinsey – a well-known, well-regarded firm. It really was that Marakon presented a better offer and opportunity for me; I knew the people and the firm, they offered a higher position, tuition reimbursement, and two projects with new big name clients I could work on from their San Francisco office.</p>\n<p><em>Few people are able to reach the Partner level at consulting firms either through choice or their own abilities. When you first rejoined Marakon did you have an end goal of becoming a Partner, or was that something that developed during your tenure? What do you think got you to Partner level, and what do you think is the most valuable thing you gained from that experience?</em></p>\n<p>When I joined consulting out of undergraduate I definitely did not have the Partner path in mind. I thought I’d do it for a couple years, learn some things, make some money; and move onto other opportunities. Through my experience I learned what an incredibly exciting field it is, where you gain a tremendous amount of knowledge and are well compensated for it. After business school (a perfect and logical time to transition out of consulting) I made the decision to go back into the field, and knew I wanted to make Partner at whatever firm I joined.</p>\n<p>For skills at the different levels of consulting, you have to realize that there’s a dramatic shift in the capabilities you need to develop in the Analyst role, Consultant role, Manager role, and Partner role. Early on as an Analyst it’s all about your hard analytical and problem solving skills, and later on in consulting it switches to communication and simplification. At the Partner level where you are selling business as well, you really need relationship and presentation skills. For making Partner, I think that the transition has been a hiccup for most folks. Early on you either got it or you didn’t, but later it’s really about making the connections and relating to people.</p>\n<p><em>You went from externally advising multi-billion dollar consumer goods company Mead Johnson to leading their internal strategy group as VP, Strategy and Corporate Development. What would you say are the major differences that separated the two roles? What would you say was the greatest challenge in that transition?</em></p>\n<p>There’s a difference on both the personal level and professional level. One thing you notice compared to working with a company from the outside is that you immediately have credibility as an internal employee, and that professionally you have a form of stability compared to a project that might be three months, might be nine months. A negative is that as a consultant you are always brought in for the major issues, whereas internally the visibility and projects may not be as top level as consultants are used to.</p>\n<p>There’s also the matter of “focus” between the two roles. To an external consultant, everything is defined &#8211; there is an engagement letter, timeline, and scope for each project. Internally, the clarity of the role is not as specific, and it’s one where you have to go with the flow. One last thing is that really, a lot of things do stay the same between one and the other. But on the inside, you certainly have more ownership and accountability, and are depended on to execute and take responsibility.</p>\n<p><em>A lot of our visitors want to jump right into a P&amp;L role as they leave consulting, and they pass on strategy roles hoping to pursue the General Manager jobs directly. What was the most appealing aspect of your post consulting strategy opportunity, and how would you sell that role to someone at the Junior Partner or Partner level?</em></p>\n<p>The strategy role is really the best first move into a company. More skills are needed for a General Management position, and in truth most consultants will not be hired right into General Management at larger companies because they lack those prudent capabilities. Strategy is the primary capability of a General Manager, but there are a lot of other dimensions to it like organization and execution. Joining a corporation in their strategy group allows you to get to know the company, build yourself into the political landscape, etc.</p>\n<p>One hurdle I will mention from consulting to internal corporate strategy, is that you do have to prove yourself and that you can actually execute and drive results.</p>\n<p><em>Being CEO of a portfolio company for a major private equity firm must be pretty thrilling. Is it what you expected?</em></p>\n<p>I don’t think there’s a way for anyone to fully grasp what a Chief Executive role entails until sitting in the chair. You are definitely in the hot seat and you feel all the pressure points of the organization. There are really two parts to it &#8211; the execution and the organizational morale – with the second being something I think I’ve really improved on over the last couple of years. Keeping a pulse of all of the folks, giving recognition and giving feedback…you have to remember that being a General Manager is really equivalent to the Chief Human Resources Officer as well.</p>\n<p><em>Having been in major leadership positions at a top consulting firm, a multi-billion dollar company, and in a CEO role of a PE portfolio company, what’s your next target in terms of personal progression and development?</em></p>\n<p>For development and career growth I personally want to pursue the GM path. A note, though, is that it seems everyone pursues the GM role because it’s the thing you &#8220;have&#8221; to do, and I would caution folks because there are a lot of other great roles out there that make plenty of impact. Not everyone is good at being a General Manager. For me, it’s in my blood, and it’s what keeps me energized. I also know it may mean considering a strategy role or another role to get there, but you have to be able to take a step back if you want to take two steps forward.</p>\n<p><em>What would you say is the most important skill that got you where you are today? What did you take specifically from consulting that makes you successful in your job now?</em></p>\n<p>I personally feel that my path, and most paths, have been highly dependent on circumstance – an opportunity has to open for you, you have to know the right people, have chemistry, etc. In addition to serendipity though, you have to be capable. It’s the ability to see serendipity and keep an eye out for the opportunities.</p>\n<p><em>Which of the skills that you gained in consulting has added the most value to your life outside of work?</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s all about building relationships. I was sitting at dinner with a friend who is also a consultant the other day, and we were discussing why it is that consultants always tend to have this strength and skill. A large part of it is because in consulting, you are brought into a small, fire drill atmosphere, and you really bond with your fellow team members. It’s not just coming into work and leaving at the end of the day – it’s a much stronger bond than you establish in corporate.</p>\n",

      "content": "<div class=\"profile-intro\">\n<p>Position: Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and Strategy</p>\n<p>Current Firm: COVERYS</p>\n<p>*At the time of this interview Bryan was the Head of U.S. Operations of Beazley plc.</p>\n<p><em>You spent a year and a half at McKinsey following a stint at the firm as a Summer Associate during business school. What made you decide to leave after only two years at the firm (did you ever consider the Partner path?), and can you describe your thought process in choosing your next opportunity? Any advice you would give members who are considering a similar move?</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s funny because I had no intention of leaving when I did, and actually was not as gracious or open during the interview process because of that. I was intent on staying into my tenure as an Engagement Manager, and instead I left just before I was to EM my first study.</p>\n<p>For me, I was pretty sure I wasn&#8217;t cut out to be a Partner. I&#8217;m sure plenty of Partners felt this way – I was positive I wasn’t smart enough (a constant feeling at McKinsey because you are challenged and grow so much every day), and I also felt I wasn&#8217;t able to commit long term to the travel demands. So that’s ultimately why I left “prematurely” when a great opportunity arose.</p>\n<p>What I knew I was sure about was the kind of opportunity I wanted to leave for. I had a passion for distribution, and loved the dynamism and creativity required to create growth within it. I was also excited for operational responsibility, and I knew I did not want an internal strategy role, because I didn’t want to be project-based anymore. The job I took at Beazley was clearly what I had been looking for, so I had to change my timing to jump at the opportunity. I think that&#8217;s basically the key here – you need to know what it is you&#8217;re trying to achieve so that you can spot the good opportunities when they come along. The role I left for just fit my goals, and I was smart enough to see the big picture because I had spent a little time thinking about it before I had any pressure to leave.</p>\n<p><em>Many consultants aim for P&amp;L responsibility in their corporate careers, something you were able to secure straight out of McKinsey with a Manager role overlooking the strategy and operations of a unit within your current company, Beazley plc. What were the similarities and differences between consulting and your first corporate role? What would you say was the greatest challenge in that transition?</em></p>\n<p>Consulting is ultimately not really about what studies or projects you do, what functions you have experience with, or what senior people you worked with regularly. It&#8217;s learning how to think about things – problems, opportunities, etc. – in a way that you can&#8217;t really learn in most corporate jobs. If you figure out how to think, you can tackle any role in nearly any industry. I firmly believe that. You can learn about industries or functions, but either you are able to think about things critically and in a structured, strategic way, or you aren&#8217;t. I got some of that from my MBA, and some from McKinsey. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d be as capable with just one or the other, with the combination being key for me.</p>\n<p>For my transition, I was lucky because I knew the industry, and I had experience with some of the functional items I would be charged with. But I had never directly managed people (not including managing someone on a work stream in a study), nor had my actions and their outcomes for a company been directly tied to each other – they were always recommendations I contributed to that played out after I was already working on something else. At Beazley, what I decided I implemented, and I lived or died by the impact. This is ultimately the biggest transition, and probably not the one anyone anticipates requiring an adjustment. I think too many ex-consultants focus on the people management, the industry / subject matter, etc. – those things matter, but you can learn. It’s deeper than that to me and something that’s more introspective, and it’s also the single most rewarding piece of the transition in my eyes. It’s not just brilliant ideas, but actually putting them into action, seeing the dynamics of people, competitors, and customers react to them, and then either winning or learning how to do better.</p>\n<p>So between consulting and corporate, the similarities are how you think and try to solve things, while the differences are in the integral role you now play in the entire lifecycle of an idea. There are more subtle differences, like dealing with HR issues and compensation discussions, but the big difference that matters is around your ideas and your involvement in them.</p>\n<p><em>You worked on many insurance-specific projects during your time at McKinsey, and now run the U.S. operations for Beazley plc. Having focused on insurance throughout your career, what are your thoughts on industry specialization and its effects on the opportunity for post-consulting advancement?</em></p>\n<p>This is definitely a mixed bag, and it becomes more so as my time in the industry increases. I started at a large property and casualty insurer (Liberty Mutual) out of college, got my MBA, and then did mostly insurance work at McKinsey before going back to a smaller insurer where I currently work today. Functionally, I have a very well-rounded resume from all of my employers, but there&#8217;s no getting around the reality that it would be hard for me to land a role in any other industry. While I&#8217;m not interested in leaving my current employer, if the need arose, I definitely appreciate the trouble I would have – or at least that I believe I would have. The positive side of industry specialization is very positive – it allowed me to move quickly at McKinsey, prove myself to clients easily and give them comfort with my views or even just my presence in their offices. It also sped up the rate at which recruiters and search firms were reaching out with opportunities, and I got a better role when I left than I would have gotten at most insurers without the depth I had. So, it clearly has helped me through to where I am today, which is a fantastic place to be at my age and tenure. If I wanted or needed to move elsewhere, it would likely be an issue.</p>\n<p>When I consider the seniority and responsibility I have at Beazley compared to the roles and careers of people who have been working for longer than I have, the bigger issue would be in finding something with the same amount of opportunity and excitement as I have today. It would be a tough sell outside of insurance, and inside of insurance would mean sacrificing things I very much value in my current role and company. But, you truly never know what will happen. I knew I wanted to go into consulting after business school but refused to even apply to McKinsey – and look how that worked out. I then tried to blow off the recruiter who called me about my current employer, and was not as easygoing, gracious, and friendly in my first interviews as I would have been if I was serious about the opportunity (I&#8217;m embarrassed to admit). We learn things as we open our minds to exposure, which is exactly what&#8217;s brought me to where I am today.</p>\n<p>In an increasingly global economy, international experience is becoming much more valued. Having stayed in a similar location throughout your career, what are your thoughts on international roles? Is it something you would consider / are considering in the future? While I have stayed in the Boston area, I wouldn&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve had a limited experience geographically. I did several international projects in my consulting days at my first Insurance firm and McKinsey, and have also lived in China for a summer in college and speak Mandarin and Spanish. I&#8217;ve worked directly in or on projects focused on many different countries and regions, and I go out of the country quite a bit with my company now. I think you can be somewhat geographically grounded yet still get international exposure really easily in consulting. Just seek it out. Given globalization, you can still get that outside of consulting quite often. Again, if you want it, just look for it.</p>\n<p><em>What do you find most exciting about the insurance industry today?</em></p>\n<p>Knowing this might not apply as broadly, what’s exciting to me is specific to the type of carrier I work for. I “grew up” in the general P&amp;C model of big, multinational insurers, and served them at McKinsey, and now I work a relatively small carrier that is anything but a generalist. We are proudly specialists. We pick our markets carefully, and we look at each risk individually. It&#8217;s truly an art and a skill at a very granular and specific level rather than the skill it takes to execute within a large portfolio approach. It also means we&#8217;re incredibly nimble and creative. The fact that this sort of thing even exists in an industry that I figured was just made up of huge carriers losing money on insurance so they had good money to invest with is what is exciting. What everyone thinks is a boring industry actually has these pockets of innovation and creativity in it. It&#8217;s very rewarding.</p>\n<p>That isn&#8217;t to say the big carriers can&#8217;t be successful or exciting, or have creativity and innovation within them. In fact, many do. I just find the most excitement to come from the way this can be when the entire company is built around this culture of innovation, creativity, growth, and the true art of underwriting.</p>\n<p><em>What would you say is the most important skill that got you where you are today? What did you take specifically from consulting that makes you successful in your job now?</em></p>\n<p>Again, it&#8217;s all about how you think about things. This is what will make you stand out to those senior to you and get you put on a list of people to watch in your organization who get moved up the ranks quickly – there&#8217;s really nothing else of substance from consulting that will affect you more as a professional. The experiences are great filler or color, but the real thing to take is how it reshapes your mind.</p>\n<p><em>As Head of U.S. Operations for Beazley, what’s your next target in terms of personal progression and development?</em></p>\n<p>My role is still evolving and solidifying, so I&#8217;m quite focused on the present. I also have an amazing boss who is fairly new to his role, so we&#8217;re on a bit of a journey together which has made it really exciting and rewarding – we have so much we&#8217;re working on that I&#8217;ve not been too focused on “what do I do next.”</p>\n<p>Something very particular to Beazley, and what makes it either really easy or incredibly hard to recruit people, is that the path ahead may not exist yet – we do not stick to a prescribed hierarchy of “Junior Some Role” to “Some Role” to “Senior Some Role”, because it doesn’t go with the creative and dynamic way we do business. We create the roles or evolve existing roles to meet our needs and the needs of our talent. To that point, depending on how you look at it, I&#8217;ve had four roles at Beazley since joining – three of them didn&#8217;t exist before I took them, and the fourth didn&#8217;t exist quite how I had it. And I’ve only been at Beazley for four years. It has taught me not to be so concerned with my next step if I&#8217;m committed to the company, because the path will evolve around me and with my hand. It&#8217;s not something I think most people understand until they&#8217;ve lived it, and certainly not something everyone can be comfortable with. For me, the freedom to grow into what I aspire to do and flex as those aspirations evolve is incredibly exciting.</p>\n</div>\n<p>More immediately, I&#8217;m working on my leadership and ability to develop others. My unit&#8217;s results are good, we solve lots of problems, and team morale is generally high. What I want to focus most on is how I develop and grow my team – both my direct reports, and their direct reports. So, for me, the next target isn&#8217;t concerned with the role so much as what I&#8217;m trying to achieve myself. The role will come from that.</p>\n<p><em>With the strictly defined trajectory and constant reviews of consulting life, do you feel it is harder for consultants to adapt to a company like yours with such fluidity around its roles?</em></p>\n<p>I think this really varies from person to person. Some people are more sold on a risk adverse path than others, but it is also counterintuitive to be wedded to one specific path coming from a consulting role. To me, it’s OK to not know the exact title or definitive responsibilities as long as it is a space you’re excited about and can grow within.</p>\n<p>Three pointers I would give to consultants to help focus their searches are to 1) know the kind of company you want, 2) know what the internal consulting teams look like (e.g. do they hire consultants?), and 3) be aware of your cultural fit. While you need to adapt to how others are just like in a client situation, you also don’t want to fake it if you’re very different from the culture of the company you’re interviewing with if you’re going to end up working there.</p>\n<p><em>Which of the skills that you gained in consulting has added the most value to your life outside of work?</em></p>\n<p>Again, it’s how I think about things. My consulting work and the mindset I developed taught me a more rational and probing approach that helps me bring others around to my view without me trying to force it on them. My style has changed. I still want to go further with this change, but I&#8217;ve seen a shift in how or why friends and family come to me for advice or to talk about things that have them worked up. I don&#8217;t think that ever happened before consulting.</p>\n<p><em>What is the coolest job you have seen a consultant / former colleague move into?</em></p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t know him, and I don&#8217;t know if this qualifies, but a former McKinsey consultant from the West Coast won Survivor a few years ago. That probably doesn&#8217;t count, but watching him, I just knew he was a McKinsey alum given how he thought and interacted with people. His occupation just said, &#8220;Consultant,&#8221; but it came out after he won. It was cool to see.</p>\n<p>Honestly, I don&#8217;t know that any one job stands out to me. People seem to generally do things they are excited about doing and all seem really happy, and they all pretty universally recognize the contribution their time at McKinsey had in getting to these roles. Some specific examples I can think of are actually ones that people turned down in favor of a different role, so it isn&#8217;t even about what you end up doing. It&#8217;s about having options that are all really interesting – if not amazing careers.</p>\n<p>I know for me, this has absolutely been the case. My time at McKinsey opened a door I am sure I&#8217;d never have known existed, and that has led to four really interesting and challenging years at a company I fully believe in and am excited to be at. I don&#8217;t know how many people can really say that about their jobs, so I feel really lucky.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p class=\"profile-intro\">Position: Operating Executive</p>\n<p>Current Firm: Silver Lake Partners</p>\n<p>*At the time of this interview Jeff was a Senior Operating Executive at Cerberus Capital Management.</p>\n<p><em>What skills should work on while still in consulting for later in their careers?</em></p>\n<p>When thinking about the skills I’ve used from consulting, I can identify three things I think really add value later on in a career that consultants should focus on while they’re in the role. One of the things that really stuck with me was the specific tool set that comes with experience across all consulting firms – the analytical tools to calculate relative market share, know how to look at industries and companies, etc. The second has to do more with how you think, and really being a “problem solver.” It sounds silly and simple to a consultant, but when you go into an industry role, people aren&#8217;t solving complex problems every day – they are busy doing their other jobs. The third is how you go about solving the problem – knowing how to break it into component parts and providing project management through it. I’ve worked on some projects where different teams are overwhelmed, and sometimes someone can really add value just by breaking it down and developing work plans around it.</p>\n<p><em>A lot of our visitors want to jump right into a P&amp;L role as they leave consulting, passing on strategy roles to pursue the GM jobs. Having transitioned from consulting into an internal strategy role yourself, and do you have any thoughts on this approach?</em></p>\n<p>I think the first decision point consultants need to make is where they want to end up – they really need to think about what they want to get out of their experience. I’ve had friends go down the more consultant-like career paths in M&amp;A, business development, and strategic planning roles. They decided to do strategy inside a company and have had great careers. Also, strategy roles shouldn’t be discounted, because they can be the best or only entrée into a company. Having said that, if they decide they really do want a GM role (everyone wants this), they should go into an operational position right away if they can. Marketing is actually a great way to do this, because it is complex and there are a lot of pieces to it.</p>\n<p>A point, though – I really think people get too hung up on the P&amp;L ownership thing. Big companies like Dell organize themselves by function a lot of the time, and people with P&amp;L are there because points of contact are needed – they don’t actually manage or run an entire organization. What consultants are really after is something like in PE firms, where you really are dealing with all of the components. With P&amp;L, consultants just need to realize the very low probability that they will go into a C-Level job right away – they often assume this because, through the function of consulting, they have been interacting on a level with clients that will likely be higher than when they switch out.</p>\n<p><em>When we’re recruiting someone from a consulting firm for a position like yours (usually someone at the Junior Partner or Partner level), some will say that they don’t see the difference between the two opportunities. Having been in both environments, how do you feel a PE role is different from a consulting role?</em></p>\n<p>There are definitely some similarities in the roles &#8211; using the consulting tool set, being a good communicator, etc. The main difference is that, in consulting, you refer to companies as “clients.” In PE, we refer to them as “our companies.” It makes a difference in what you do and how you do it. While many management consulting firms will deny it, at the end of the day their product is a recommendation that comes in the form of a PowerPoint presentation. And I’ve done that before. In what I do now, I barely ever use PowerPoint presentations. I’ll get a 6-month project for a company and I have a revenue target – that’s my product.</p>\n<p><em>Several of the other large private equity firms have groups comparable to the one you work in today. Do you have a sense for how much variation there is among roles such as yours?</em></p>\n<p>It used to not be the case, but most PE firms do have internal ops groups now, and there are some differences. One big difference in the roles within these groups is a function of size. Some firms have large internal groups and some firms have small ones &#8211; this impacts what you do. At Cerberus we have a large group, are deployed in teams, and have more project-oriented assignments. For smaller groups, one person can be deployed on a project where the role takes on a more advisory / consultative approach. This point brings me to the second difference – the business model. Cerberus hardly ever uses outside consultants because we go to the site and actually manage the projects ourselves. For firms with smaller ops groups, the role someone plays is more about identifying improvement needs and the right external consulting firm to implement the necessary changes, and then managing those external consultants.</p>\n<p><em>As an operations executive at leading PE firm Cerberus, what do you like best about your current job?</em></p>\n<p>The variety of companies and business situations I am able to work with – I’ve worked with a gun manufacturer, a paper producer, a software company, etc., in situations from bankruptcy to ones with high growth targets.</p>\n<p><em>You previously led marketing for the $14 billion EMEA region of Dell Inc. Did you anticipate a role like the one you had when you joined the company? How influential do you think your international experience has been to your success, and what advice do you have for consultants considering international roles?</em></p>\n<p>I didn’t go into Dell with expectations either way, but when the opportunity arose, it wasn’t necessarily something that I had anticipated. It happened quickly, I accepted quickly, and it was a fantastic professional and personal experience. I learned that stereotypes are true for some reasons, and completely wrong for other reasons. It’s much like when consultants transition to an outside company and are really excited – they then find out that the real world is very messy. They do not have the support like they did in consulting, with all of the facts and people who would work all hours of the night to get a project done. It can be a surprise.</p>\n",

      "short_URL": "http://wp.me/p7C5yw-2co",
      "content": "<hr />\n<p><em>As published in <a href=\"http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2011/04/29/should-you-take-an-overseas-job-assignment/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune</a>, April 29, 2011. </em></p>\n<p>By Anne Fisher, contributor<br />\nFORTUNE –</p>\n<p><strong>Dear Annie:</strong> I am an engineer by training, currently running a big chunk of North American manufacturing for a global Fortune 500 company. Recently, the head of my division has been sounding me out about moving either to Spain, to tackle some productivity issues at a couple of plants we have there, or else to one of several Latin American countries where we are starting up new ventures. (I assume that these particular options are on the table because I’m of Hispanic extraction and already speak fluent Spanish.) I’m having trouble deciding whether to jump at either of these offers, and if so, which one. Moving overseas for a year or two would certainly be challenging and interesting. But friends of mine, who took similar assignments and later regretted doing so, warn me that I’d be “out of sight, out of mind” back at headquarters and that this would ultimately trip up my career. What do you think? — <em>Not Packing Yet</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dear Not Packing:</strong> No question about it, this is a complicated decision, and one that more and more managers are facing. The number of employees sent abroad rose last year for the first time since 2006, says a study from Brookfield Global Relocation Services called the Global Relocation Trends 2011 Survey Report. According to the study, a record-setting 61% of companies around the world expect to ship more managers to foreign shores in 2011.</p>\n<p>Those globetrotting managers may have an edge over their stay-at-home peers. International experience is “more frequently becoming a prerequisite” for top-level executive jobs, notes Mansour Javidan, dean of research at international business school Thunderbird’s Global Mindset Institute.</p>\n<p>Recent studies suggest he’s right. Executive development consultants Healthy Companies International, whose clients include Intel (INTC), Northrop Grumman (NOC), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), and Boeing (BA), examined the career paths of C-level managers at Fortune 100 companies and found that more than 7 out of 10 have held management jobs in foreign climes. That’s up from fewer than 5 in 10 a decade ago.</p>\n<p>“In many big companies now, you need at least one substantial international assignment if you want to climb the executive ladder,” says Bruce Raines, CEO of New York City executive search firm Raines International.</p>\n<p>Before you start packing, however, consider a couple of important caveats. First, not everyone is cut out to thrive in an unfamiliar place. The Global Mindset Institute has identified three main traits that successful expats share (and a quiz that companies can use to determine whether overseas candidates have them).</p>\n<p>The three predictors of effectiveness in a foreign assignment: Solid knowledge of the workings of international business and a capacity to quickly absorb information; openness to different cultures and a knack for adapting to new customs and mores; and “social capital,” defined as the ability to bring people together, create alliances, and influence others who are culturally or politically different.</p>\n<p>Without all three of these skills, says Mansour Javidan, “people come home before their contracted time, or they don’t achieve their goals. Business is lost, and professional and personal relationships can be damaged.” So can a manager’s career.</p>\n<p>Before you accept an overseas gig, make an honest inventory of your strengths and weaknesses in those three areas, and don’t hesitate to ask HR if training is available to help you prepare for your new role. At most big global companies these days, it is.</p>\n<p>The fact that you already speak Spanish should give you a big leg up. “All managers who take an overseas assignment must learn the language and study the culture,” says Bruce Raines. “I can’t stress that enough, and Americans in general tend to be slower off the mark in this regard than managers from other countries.”</p>\n<p>As for your fear that you’ll be “out of sight, out of mind” at headquarters, Raines says you needn’t worry too much: “Before the Internet, people sent overseas were isolated. Now, with Skype, videoconferencing, and all the other technology that’s available, you’re never really out of touch.”</p>\n<p>That’s not to say that going abroad poses no risks to your career. You say that your division head has mentioned sending you abroad for “a year or two.” Raines says one hazard he has often seen arises when that year or two turns into five or six.</p>\n<p>“This happens a lot,” he says. “By the time you do get back, after a long stint abroad, the organization has changed so that there’s no comparable job for you. So you either take a step down or leave the company.” Gulp.</p>\n<p>To be on the safe side, Raines urges you not to take an overseas assignment “unless it is one that will help your career even if you end up leaving your current employer.”</p>\n<p>Raines recommends that you try to gain direct responsibility for the company’s bottom line in as large a region as possible because you can transfer those skills to other companies.</p>\n<p>Choosing whether to go to Spain or to Latin America, Raines adds, largely depends on your feelings about risk.</p>\n<p>“If you’re very entrepreneurial, emerging markets — including Brazil, the rest of South America, Viet Nam, Moscow, China — are the frontier. You can build a huge reputation as a sharpshooter and move up quickly.”</p>\n<p>If you’re more conservative and risk-averse, on the other hand, “you may do better in Europe or another established market, where there are already established procedures and a track record.”</p>\n<p>One more thing: If you do decide to make the leap, check out Expat Info Desk, a site run by seasoned expatriate George Eves that offers a wealth of wisdom on everything from relocating your pets to hammering out a workable expat employment contract.</p>\n<p><em>Find the original article <a href=\"http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2011/04/29/should-you-take-an-overseas-job-assignment/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
